On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded\\nregion within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9\\nmm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may\\nrepresent an unusual focus of red marrow. No sclerosis is seen\\non the corresponding plain films. There is a small right hip\\njoint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint\\nas well, at the upper limits of normal. There is no soft tissue\\nabnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.\\nIMPRESSION: 1. Small right hip joint effusion. 2. No bone marrow\\nedema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis. 3. Nonspecific small\\nfocus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral\\nhead is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red\\nmarrow.\\n\\nTTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is\\nsevere symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\\nventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular\\nwall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is\\nhyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18 mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is\\nidentified. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\\nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally\\nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The\\nincreased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac\\noutput. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no\\nsystolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)\\nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\\nsystolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.\\nThe effusion appears circumferential. There are no\\nechocardiographic signs of tamponade.\\nIMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\\nhyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient.\\nMild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.\\nFindings consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**],\\npulmonary hypertension has developed (also present on the study\\nfrom [**2140-5-20**]). Pericardial effusion is also new.\\n\\nV/Q scan ([**9-21**]): Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol\\nin 8 views demonstrate no focal defects with improved\\nventilation to the posterior right basal segment.  Perfusion\\nimages in the same 8 views show improved perfusion to the\\nposterior right basal segement with a persistent small defect\\nbut no new findings.\\nChest x-ray shows cardiomgealy and left basilar atelectasis.\\nIMPRESSION: Improved V/Q scan from [**9-/2139**] with no findings to\\nsuggest acute pulmonary embolism.\\n\\nB/L upper ext U/S ([**9-21**]): Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of\\nthe\\nright and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,\\nbasilic and cephalic veins were performed. There is nonocclusive\\nfocal thrombus seen in the left subclavian vein, where the vein\\nis not fully compressible. Flow is seen in the region,\\nindicating that the thrombus is nonocclusive. Elsewhere, normal\\nflow, augmentation, compressibility were appropriate and\\nwaveforms are demonstrated.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. Focal nonocclusive thrombus in the left subclavian vein.\\n2.

Patient was on the floor on [**9-20**],\\ngiven morphine for the hip pain.  She then had an episode of\\nhypotension and unresponsiveness and transferred to the MICU for\\ncloser monitoring. The patient got 2L IVFs and narcan and\\nimproved, in fact, found to be hypertensive upon arrival to\\nMICU.\\n.\\nMICU Course: On [**9-20**], the patient triggered for hypotension\\n(82/45), hypothermia (92.9) and altered mental status with\\ndifficult arousability in setting of recent blood transfusion.\\nConcern was for sepsis, autonomic seizure, transfusion reaction,\\npulmonary embolus and/or narcosis.  Mental status cleared\\nsomewhat with narcan. Renal c/s felt episode likely [**2-11**]\\naccumulation of morphine active metabolites. V/Q scan\\ndemonstrated improvement since prior study. Patient's home\\nprednisone dose was increased from 5 to 15mg with thought that\\npatient may be stressed in setting of acute illness. She was\\nfebrile on [**9-21**] and resultingly started in vancomycin,\\naztreonam, and levofloxacin. PD fluid was not c/w SBP. CXR was\\nclear. Urine culture and blood cultures are pending. Patient's\\nBP was in the 110s so hydralazine was stopped. Her other BP meds\\nwere otherwise continued.  Plan was/is to follow renal recs for\\nPD. If, in 24-48 hours (once cultures have had 48-72 hours to\\ngrow) no source has been located, would d/c antibiotics except\\nfor levofloxacin.  Would continue levoflox for total 5 day\\ncourse for pneumonia possibly ? aspiration pneumonitis during\\nepisode of altered mental status.  If patient has leg pain\\nagain, may consider neurogenic source such a piriformis syndrome\\nas suggested by neurology. Would add neurontin 100mg TID with\\nroom to titrate up to 300mg TID. Neuro also recommended PT with\\nTENS unit and referral to pain clinic although patient's pain is\\ncurrently absent.\\n.\\nFYI **** per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] --- Because of ? increase in\\ncardiomegaly on CXR, she got an echo yesterday.  In addition to\\nher known HOCM, this showed (1) a small pericardial effusion,\\nand (2) pulmonary hypertension with an estimated tricuspid\\ngradient of 50 mm Hg. They probably need to be followed up over\\ntime (particularly the pulmonary hypertension).  We did\\nevaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making\\nchronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.\\nIt would be good if we could arrange a PULMONARY CLINIC FOLLOW\\nUP for Ms. [**Known lastname **] after discharge with either [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].****\\n\\n.\\nShe underwent CT head, and V/Q scan which were unremarkable.\\nHer steroid dose was increased to 15mg given concern for need\\nfor stress dose steroids. After transfer from the MICU, her\\nsteroids were dropped back to 5mg, her home dose with the\\napproval of [**Last Name (un) **].\\n.\\nHer hypotensive episode was thought to be due to a delayed\\nclearing of the morphine due to her renal failure.  Her\\nhydralazine was discontinued.  On day 2 of her MICU stay, she\\ndeveloped a fever to 102.  She was pan-cultured (blood, urine,\\nperitoneal dialysate) without obvious source of infection.\\nBroad spectrum abx were started (vanco, cipro, aztreonam (pcn\\nallergy)) empirically.  There was question of retrocardiac\\nopacity on CXR, though not clear. Rheum consult obtained given\\nhip discomfort, who felt septic joint unlikely.  Neurology\\nconsult obtained who felt autonomic seizure unlikely.\\n.\\nPt initiated peritoneal dialysis.  In this setting she has been\\nhaving some nausea, which has made taking her home labetalol\\ndifficult, resulting in some rising BPs.  She is called out to\\nmedical service for ongoing management and workup of fever,\\nnausea, and hypertension.  Her hip pain has resolved completely\\nwithout further intervention.\\n.\\nFloor course:\\nFever: Spike fever in MICU to 102. Started on Levoquin,\\nAztreonam, and Vanc. Source unclear at this point, but CXR with\\nquestion of retrocardiac opacity. There is a possibility of\\naspiration pneumonitis. Other etiologies include peritoneal\\nfluid (PD cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have\\nany indwelling lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be\\nseptic arthritis but no pain with movement on exam makes this\\nless likely. Peritoneal dialysis cultures negative so far.\\nContinued levo/vanco/aztreonam for 2 days empirically. Then\\nd/ced the Abx as no infectious etiologies were found. Steroids\\nback to home dosage. BCx, UCx (final neg), Peritoneal cultures\\nnegative at discharge.\\n.\\n# Labile blood pressure: h/o of difficult to control BP with\\nepisodes of hypertensive emergency in the past. Normal SBP runs\\nin 170s. Having nausea in setting of new PD, no evidence of\\nintracranial bleeding on clinical exam, though INR had been\\nsupratherapeutic so remains in differential, though not\\nbradycardic. Continue home BP meds :Labetalol 900 mg PO TID but\\ndifficult for patient to tolerate due to nausea, Aliskiren *NF*\\n150 mg Oral [**Hospital1 **], NIFEdipine CR 60 mg PO DAILY, clonidine patch,\\nhydralazine given hypertensive in setting of nausa.\\n.\\n# Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or\\nfracture on MRI though there is a small effusion. Pain resolved\\nwithout intervention. Continued to monitor\\nand would avoid narcotics, restart slowly if pain resumes.\\nPhysical therapy to follow as an outpatient. [**Last Name (un) 18183**] followed.\\nPlease see consult note.\\n.\\n# Hyperkalemia: Chronic issue. Patient takes kayexalate\\nintermittently per her report (last dose [**Last Name (un) 766**]). Monitored K\\nbut patient did not need it on floor.\\n\\n# CKD V: Renal following. Did well with PD on [**9-22**] but did\\nreport some nause and cramping. She was not tolerating all 1.5L\\nin exchanges on discharge.\\n\\n# Anemia: Hct stable around 20. S/p 1 U PRBCs in MICU with Hct\\n20.1 to 21.9.

The patient was seen and evaluated in the MICU by the CCU\\nteam prior to transfer. The patient was transferred in a guarded\\ncondition.\\n.\\nHospital Course By System:\\n   1. Vascular: Patient was initially admitted to the vascular\\nservice. He was evaluated and it was determined that surgical\\nintervention in his case is not warranted at this time. His\\nmanagement has consisted of [**Month/Day/Year **] pressure control, and\\nmonitoring for signs of vascular compromise. Initial management\\nof hypertension required multiple PO medications in combination\\nwith IV antihypertensives. Initially due to the rising creatine\\nin the setting of vascular compromise to one or both kidneys,\\nACEi and ARBs were held due to concern about further\\nhypoperfusion to the kidney. Renal medicine was consulted on\\n[**9-27**] and approved the use of an ACEi. The patient responded\\nwell to this and was able to remove all IV antihypertensive\\nmedications. His pressure has remained stable with occasional\\nelevations in systolic [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures related to agitation in\\nperiods of light sedation. Quality of pulses were followed and\\nsaw improvement in right lower extremety pulses over his\\nhospitalization. Lactate levels were drawn along with serial\\nabdominal exams to evaluate for signs of bowel ischemia. He was\\nguaiac negative and had no other signs of acute bowel ischemia.\\nExtremeties remained warm with good capillary refill. Creatine\\nstabilized with a maximum value of 2.1 on hospital day 12.  On\\ndischarge the creatinine had trended down to 1.2.  No signs of\\nacute ischemic injury to the carotid arteries. During physical\\ntherapy and daily ambulation, he denies any claudication or\\nnumbness to either legs. Renal perfusion scan performed on [**10-5**]\\nshowed 29% function in the right kidney and 71% of renal\\nfunction performed by the left kidney. Pt was slowly weaned off\\nbp medications as his agitation and kidney function improved.\\nHe was discharged on Propanolol 160mg [**Hospital1 **], Amlodipine 10mg\\ndaily, and Lisinopril 10mg po bid for [**Hospital1 **] pressure management.\\nHe will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Cardiology and Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient will make a follow up appointment with a\\nPCP in the [**Location (un) 5503**] area.  On discharge pt's bllod pressure\\nwas [**Last Name (un) 74635**] well controlled at 110s/70s.\\n.\\n   2. Respiratory: Patient was initially intubated on [**9-16**] for\\nincreasing agitation and poor [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure control secondary\\nto the agitation. During the first days of the admission, he\\nbecame increasingly agitated and at time of intubation, required\\n4 security guards to restrain him for his own safety. He was\\ninitially started on AC but switched to SIMV+PS as tolerated. On\\n[**9-18**] chest x-ray showed signs of a right middle lobe\\ninfiltrate. He was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxican, and\\nZosyn for broad coverage. Culture results indicated the presence\\nof streptococcus pneumoniae (oxacillin sensitive) and Moraxella\\nCatastalsis. Antibiotic regimen was changed to Zosyn only and\\ndosed appropriately for renal function. Patient completed the 10\\nday course on [**9-30**]. Ventilator settings were decreased as\\ntolerated in anticipation of weaning the ventilator and the\\npatient was successfully extubated on [**9-30**]. Repeat CXRs showed\\ngradual improvement in lung function and resolving infiltrates.\\nPatient had spiked another fever on [**9-30**] with worsening CXR and\\nnoted infiltrates. He was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime\\nfor 7 day course. At time of discharge there were no respiratory\\nissues and pt had remained afebrile without a oxygen requirement\\nduring ambulation as well as at rest.\\n.\\n  3. DVT: On [**9-20**] the patient's right arm was disproportantly\\nlarger and firm compared to the left arm. The patient underwent\\na duplex ultrasound which showed non obstructing DVT in the\\naxillary vein not extending to the subclavian. PICC line in the\\nright AC was removed. The patient was not a candidate for\\nanticoagulation due to his other issues and was followed\\nclinically with no further complications with a resolution of\\nthe swelling in his arm prior to d/c.\\n.\\n  4. Pain Control / Sedation: Patient was initially started on\\npropofol in the MICU and switched to Dexmedetomidine with\\nDilaudid bolus PRN. On transfer to the CCU he was switched to\\nVersed and Fentanyl. During his admission, he required\\nincreasing doses of sedative with frequent boluses. On Hospital\\nday 13 he was started on Methadone as an alternative to\\nFentanyl. He also was switched to PRN boluses of Ativan instead\\nwith good control. For further sedation, he was started on\\nstanding does of Haldol with good result. After extubation,\\nsedation and pain control was titrated down to patient comfort\\nand the patient's mental status improved. Neurology was\\nconsulted for evaluation of mental status. As the patient's\\ncognition improved with time and removal of sedating medication,\\nthe recommendation was an EEG which showed diffuse slowing\\nconsistent with a toxic/metabolic picture. Patient's mental\\nstatus improved with the removal of all sedating medications. At\\ntime of discharge he was able to make appropriate cognitive\\ndecisions and was believed to be able to manage his care at\\nhome. Patient was cleared to go home by Occupational Therapy and\\nwas discharged home in a stable condition.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nNone\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded\\nregion within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9\\nmm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may\\nrepresent an unusual focus of red marrow. No sclerosis is seen\\non the corresponding plain films. There is a small right hip\\njoint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint\\nas well, at the upper limits of normal. There is no soft tissue\\nabnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.\\nIMPRESSION: 1. Small right hip joint effusion. 2. No bone marrow\\nedema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis. 3. Nonspecific small\\nfocus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral\\nhead is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red\\nmarrow.\\n\\nTTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is\\nsevere symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\\nventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular\\nwall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is\\nhyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18 mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is\\nidentified. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\\nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally\\nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The\\nincreased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac\\noutput. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no\\nsystolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)\\nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\\nsystolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.\\nThe effusion appears circumferential. There are no\\nechocardiographic signs of tamponade.\\nIMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\\nhyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient.\\nMild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.\\nFindings consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**],\\npulmonary hypertension has developed (also present on the study\\nfrom [**2140-5-20**]). Pericardial effusion is also new.\\n\\nV/Q scan ([**9-21**]): Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol\\nin 8 views demonstrate no focal defects with improved\\nventilation to the posterior right basal segment.  Perfusion\\nimages in the same 8 views show improved perfusion to the\\nposterior right basal segement with a persistent small defect\\nbut no new findings.\\nChest x-ray shows cardiomgealy and left basilar atelectasis.\\nIMPRESSION: Improved V/Q scan from [**9-/2139**] with no findings to\\nsuggest acute pulmonary embolism.\\n\\nB/L upper ext U/S ([**9-21**]): Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of\\nthe\\nright and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,\\nbasilic and cephalic veins were performed. There is nonocclusive\\nfocal thrombus seen in the left subclavian vein, where the vein\\nis not fully compressible. Flow is seen in the region,\\nindicating that the thrombus is nonocclusive. Elsewhere, normal\\nflow, augmentation, compressibility were appropriate and\\nwaveforms are demonstrated.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. Focal nonocclusive thrombus in the left subclavian vein.\\n2.

Patient was on the floor on [**9-20**],\\ngiven morphine for the hip pain.  She then had an episode of\\nhypotension and unresponsiveness and transferred to the MICU for\\ncloser monitoring. The patient got 2L IVFs and narcan and\\nimproved, in fact, found to be hypertensive upon arrival to\\nMICU.\\n.\\nMICU Course: On [**9-20**], the patient triggered for hypotension\\n(82/45), hypothermia (92.9) and altered mental status with\\ndifficult arousability in setting of recent blood transfusion.\\nConcern was for sepsis, autonomic seizure, transfusion reaction,\\npulmonary embolus and/or narcosis.  Mental status cleared\\nsomewhat with narcan. Renal c/s felt episode likely [**2-11**]\\naccumulation of morphine active metabolites. V/Q scan\\ndemonstrated improvement since prior study. Patient's home\\nprednisone dose was increased from 5 to 15mg with thought that\\npatient may be stressed in setting of acute illness. She was\\nfebrile on [**9-21**] and resultingly started in vancomycin,\\naztreonam, and levofloxacin. PD fluid was not c/w SBP. CXR was\\nclear. Urine culture and blood cultures are pending. Patient's\\nBP was in the 110s so hydralazine was stopped. Her other BP meds\\nwere otherwise continued.  Plan was/is to follow renal recs for\\nPD. If, in 24-48 hours (once cultures have had 48-72 hours to\\ngrow) no source has been located, would d/c antibiotics except\\nfor levofloxacin.  Would continue levoflox for total 5 day\\ncourse for pneumonia possibly ? aspiration pneumonitis during\\nepisode of altered mental status.  If patient has leg pain\\nagain, may consider neurogenic source such a piriformis syndrome\\nas suggested by neurology. Would add neurontin 100mg TID with\\nroom to titrate up to 300mg TID. Neuro also recommended PT with\\nTENS unit and referral to pain clinic although patient's pain is\\ncurrently absent.\\n.\\nFYI **** per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] --- Because of ? increase in\\ncardiomegaly on CXR, she got an echo yesterday.  In addition to\\nher known HOCM, this showed (1) a small pericardial effusion,\\nand (2) pulmonary hypertension with an estimated tricuspid\\ngradient of 50 mm Hg. They probably need to be followed up over\\ntime (particularly the pulmonary hypertension).  We did\\nevaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making\\nchronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.\\nIt would be good if we could arrange a PULMONARY CLINIC FOLLOW\\nUP for Ms. [**Known lastname **] after discharge with either [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].****\\n\\n.\\nShe underwent CT head, and V/Q scan which were unremarkable.\\nHer steroid dose was increased to 15mg given concern for need\\nfor stress dose steroids. After transfer from the MICU, her\\nsteroids were dropped back to 5mg, her home dose with the\\napproval of [**Last Name (un) **].\\n.\\nHer hypotensive episode was thought to be due to a delayed\\nclearing of the morphine due to her renal failure.  Her\\nhydralazine was discontinued.  On day 2 of her MICU stay, she\\ndeveloped a fever to 102.  She was pan-cultured (blood, urine,\\nperitoneal dialysate) without obvious source of infection.\\nBroad spectrum abx were started (vanco, cipro, aztreonam (pcn\\nallergy)) empirically.  There was question of retrocardiac\\nopacity on CXR, though not clear. Rheum consult obtained given\\nhip discomfort, who felt septic joint unlikely.  Neurology\\nconsult obtained who felt autonomic seizure unlikely.\\n.\\nPt initiated peritoneal dialysis.  In this setting she has been\\nhaving some nausea, which has made taking her home labetalol\\ndifficult, resulting in some rising BPs.  She is called out to\\nmedical service for ongoing management and workup of fever,\\nnausea, and hypertension.  Her hip pain has resolved completely\\nwithout further intervention.\\n.\\nFloor course:\\nFever: Spike fever in MICU to 102. Started on Levoquin,\\nAztreonam, and Vanc. Source unclear at this point, but CXR with\\nquestion of retrocardiac opacity. There is a possibility of\\naspiration pneumonitis. Other etiologies include peritoneal\\nfluid (PD cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have\\nany indwelling lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be\\nseptic arthritis but no pain with movement on exam makes this\\nless likely. Peritoneal dialysis cultures negative so far.\\nContinued levo/vanco/aztreonam for 2 days empirically. Then\\nd/ced the Abx as no infectious etiologies were found. Steroids\\nback to home dosage. BCx, UCx (final neg), Peritoneal cultures\\nnegative at discharge.\\n.\\n# Labile blood pressure: h/o of difficult to control BP with\\nepisodes of hypertensive emergency in the past. Normal SBP runs\\nin 170s. Having nausea in setting of new PD, no evidence of\\nintracranial bleeding on clinical exam, though INR had been\\nsupratherapeutic so remains in differential, though not\\nbradycardic. Continue home BP meds :Labetalol 900 mg PO TID but\\ndifficult for patient to tolerate due to nausea, Aliskiren *NF*\\n150 mg Oral [**Hospital1 **], NIFEdipine CR 60 mg PO DAILY, clonidine patch,\\nhydralazine given hypertensive in setting of nausa.\\n.\\n# Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or\\nfracture on MRI though there is a small effusion. Pain resolved\\nwithout intervention. Continued to monitor\\nand would avoid narcotics, restart slowly if pain resumes.\\nPhysical therapy to follow as an outpatient.

Monitored K\\nbut patient did not need it on floor.\\n\\n# CKD V: Renal following. Did well with PD on [**9-22**] but did\\nreport some nause and cramping. She was not tolerating all 1.5L\\nin exchanges on discharge.\\n\\n# Anemia: Hct stable around 20. S/p 1 U PRBCs in MICU with Hct\\n20.1 to 21.9.

Extremity examination shows right\\nextremity is warm and left extremity proximal to the medial\\nmalleolus with 3 by 4 ulceration with surrounding erythema\\nand cellulitis.  Pulse examination shows palpable femorals\\nbilaterally with palpable popliteals bilaterally.  The right\\ndorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse were\\ndopplerable and the left dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior\\ntibial pulse were dopplerable.\\n\\nLABORATORY:  CBC with a white blood cell count of 20.1,\\nhematocrit 29.7, platelets 62K, BUN 12, creatinine 0.6, K\\n3.6.  [**Name (NI) 2591**] PT/INR 16.5 and 1.9, PTT 35.  Chest x-ray was no\\nactive cardiopulmonary disease.  Electrocardiogram showed no\\nevidence of ischemia and normal sinus rhythm with a rate of\\n81.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Vascular\\nService.  He was continued on his preadmission medications\\nincluding Unasyn 1.5 grams q 6 hours.  Surgical dressings\\nwere normal saline and wet to dry dressings b.i.d. to the\\neffected ulcer site.  The patient underwent venous duplexes\\non [**2190-6-8**] to asses for vein conduit for bypass grafting.  The\\npatient underwent on [**2190-6-6**] an arteriogram, which\\ndemonstrated a gradient across the aortic to the common iliac\\non the left with a 12 mm gradient.  Along the common iliac\\nthere was more gradient of 180 mg across the stent.  It was\\n156 mm with stenosis at the distal start and an occluded left\\nsuperficial femoral artery popliteal.  The AT refilled below\\nthe fibular head and was open all the way to the dorsalis\\npedis pulses.  The patient tolerated the arteriogram.  PICC\\nlines were attempted to provide intravenous access, but the\\nveins were too small and this was aborted.\\n\\nThe patient had an arterial blood gas done in preparation for\\nrevascularization of his lower leg, pH was 7.51, PO2 61, PCO2\\nwas 36, CO2 30, base excess 5.  The patient underwent on\\n[**2190-6-11**] a left femoral AT bypass graft to the PTFE.  He\\ntolerated the procedure well.  He was transferred to the PACU\\nin stable condition.  Immediate postoperative check he was\\nhemodynamically stable.  Postoperatively, hematocrit was\\n32.4, PTT 84.8, BUN 6, creatinine 0.6.  His extremity was\\nwarm with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse and absent patient.\\nHe continued to do well and was transferred to the VICU.\\nPostoperative day one there were no overnight events.  He\\ncontinued on Vancomycin, Levo and Flagyl.  His diet was\\nadvanced as tolerated.  He required Lasix to diurese.  He was\\nD-lined and transferred to the regular nursing floor.  On [**6-14**]\\nthe patient underwent debridement of the left ankle\\nulceration he tolerated the procedure well and was\\ntransferred to the regular nursing floor.  Coumadin was begun\\non 3 mg per day, ambulation was instituted.  A request for\\nPICC line was requested, but this could not be done.  He was\\ncontinued on his antibiotics and the Foley was discontinued\\nand rehab screening was begun.\\n\\nPhysical therapy saw the patient and recommended short term\\nrehabilitation to improve his mobility and gait.  A reattempt\\nwill be made to place the PICC line at the bedside.  If this\\nis unable to be done, then it will be done in interventional\\nradiology.  He will continue on his antibiotics for a total\\nof two more weeks post discharge.\\n\\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  He is to follow up with Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks time.  Goal INR is 2.0 to 2.5.  INR\\nshould be monitored until the patient has reached the steady\\ntherapeutic state.  Coumadin should be adjusted to maintain\\nINR goal.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Folic acid 1 mg q.d., calcium\\ncarbonate 500 mg q.d., multivitamin tablet one q.d.,\\nSimvastatin 10 mg q.d., magnesium oxide 400 mg q.d.,\\nAlbuterol puff one to two q 6 hours prn, Ipratropium bromide\\npuffs 2 inhalers q.i.d., Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. hold for\\nsystolic blood pressure less then 100 and heart rate less\\nthen 60.

The patient was seen and evaluated in the MICU by the CCU\\nteam prior to transfer. The patient was transferred in a guarded\\ncondition.\\n.\\nHospital Course By System:\\n   1. Vascular: Patient was initially admitted to the vascular\\nservice. He was evaluated and it was determined that surgical\\nintervention in his case is not warranted at this time. His\\nmanagement has consisted of [**Month/Day/Year **] pressure control, and\\nmonitoring for signs of vascular compromise. Initial management\\nof hypertension required multiple PO medications in combination\\nwith IV antihypertensives. Initially due to the rising creatine\\nin the setting of vascular compromise to one or both kidneys,\\nACEi and ARBs were held due to concern about further\\nhypoperfusion to the kidney. Renal medicine was consulted on\\n[**9-27**] and approved the use of an ACEi. The patient responded\\nwell to this and was able to remove all IV antihypertensive\\nmedications. His pressure has remained stable with occasional\\nelevations in systolic [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures related to agitation in\\nperiods of light sedation. Quality of pulses were followed and\\nsaw improvement in right lower extremety pulses over his\\nhospitalization. Lactate levels were drawn along with serial\\nabdominal exams to evaluate for signs of bowel ischemia. He was\\nguaiac negative and had no other signs of acute bowel ischemia.\\nExtremeties remained warm with good capillary refill. Creatine\\nstabilized with a maximum value of 2.1 on hospital day 12.  On\\ndischarge the creatinine had trended down to 1.2.  No signs of\\nacute ischemic injury to the carotid arteries. During physical\\ntherapy and daily ambulation, he denies any claudication or\\nnumbness to either legs. Renal perfusion scan performed on [**10-5**]\\nshowed 29% function in the right kidney and 71% of renal\\nfunction performed by the left kidney. Pt was slowly weaned off\\nbp medications as his agitation and kidney function improved.\\nHe was discharged on Propanolol 160mg [**Hospital1 **], Amlodipine 10mg\\ndaily, and Lisinopril 10mg po bid for [**Hospital1 **] pressure management.\\nHe will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Cardiology and Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient will make a follow up appointment with a\\nPCP in the [**Location (un) 5503**] area.  On discharge pt's bllod pressure\\nwas [**Last Name (un) 74635**] well controlled at 110s/70s.\\n.\\n   2. Respiratory: Patient was initially intubated on [**9-16**] for\\nincreasing agitation and poor [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure control secondary\\nto the agitation. During the first days of the admission, he\\nbecame increasingly agitated and at time of intubation, required\\n4 security guards to restrain him for his own safety. He was\\ninitially started on AC but switched to SIMV+PS as tolerated. On\\n[**9-18**] chest x-ray showed signs of a right middle lobe\\ninfiltrate. He was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxican, and\\nZosyn for broad coverage. Culture results indicated the presence\\nof streptococcus pneumoniae (oxacillin sensitive) and Moraxella\\nCatastalsis. Antibiotic regimen was changed to Zosyn only and\\ndosed appropriately for renal function. Patient completed the 10\\nday course on [**9-30**]. Ventilator settings were decreased as\\ntolerated in anticipation of weaning the ventilator and the\\npatient was successfully extubated on [**9-30**]. Repeat CXRs showed\\ngradual improvement in lung function and resolving infiltrates.\\nPatient had spiked another fever on [**9-30**] with worsening CXR and\\nnoted infiltrates. He was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime\\nfor 7 day course. At time of discharge there were no respiratory\\nissues and pt had remained afebrile without a oxygen requirement\\nduring ambulation as well as at rest.\\n.\\n  3. DVT: On [**9-20**] the patient's right arm was disproportantly\\nlarger and firm compared to the left arm. The patient underwent\\na duplex ultrasound which showed non obstructing DVT in the\\naxillary vein not extending to the subclavian. PICC line in the\\nright AC was removed. The patient was not a candidate for\\nanticoagulation due to his other issues and was followed\\nclinically with no further complications with a resolution of\\nthe swelling in his arm prior to d/c.\\n.\\n  4. Pain Control / Sedation: Patient was initially started on\\npropofol in the MICU and switched to Dexmedetomidine with\\nDilaudid bolus PRN. On transfer to the CCU he was switched to\\nVersed and Fentanyl. During his admission, he required\\nincreasing doses of sedative with frequent boluses. On Hospital\\nday 13 he was started on Methadone as an alternative to\\nFentanyl. He also was switched to PRN boluses of Ativan instead\\nwith good control. For further sedation, he was started on\\nstanding does of Haldol with good result. After extubation,\\nsedation and pain control was titrated down to patient comfort\\nand the patient's mental status improved. Neurology was\\nconsulted for evaluation of mental status. As the patient's\\ncognition improved with time and removal of sedating medication,\\nthe recommendation was an EEG which showed diffuse slowing\\nconsistent with a toxic/metabolic picture. Patient's mental\\nstatus improved with the removal of all sedating medications. At\\ntime of discharge he was able to make appropriate cognitive\\ndecisions and was believed to be able to manage his care at\\nhome. Patient was cleared to go home by Occupational Therapy and\\nwas discharged home in a stable condition.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nNone\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1. Lisinopril 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\\nday).\\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\\n2.

This is a condition\\nwhere the large artery that runs through your chest and abdomen\\nhas split into two seperate openings that can cause problems\\nwith [**Name2 (NI) **] flow to organs such as intestines and Kidneys. The\\nbest treatment for your type of disection is to keep your [**Name2 (NI) **]\\npressure below 120/80 with medications. You will need to limit\\nthe amount of salt in yor diet and follow up with a primary care\\nprovider of your choosing and a cardologist at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].\\nIf you start having worsening chest pains, discomfort in your\\nlegs while walking, or problems thinking clearly you should\\nvisit your local emergency room for treatment.\\n.\\nYou were seen by cardiothoracic surgery as well as vascular\\nsurgery.  You will need to followup with them in clinic.\\n\\nYou were also seen by the Renal service for your worsening\\nkidney function due to your aortic dissection.  Prior to\\ndischarge, your kidney function had markedly improved.\\n\\nYou were also seen by our physical therapists who felt that you\\nwould benefit from 24 hour supervision initially and\\nrehabilitation.  You did not want to go to an inpatient\\nrehabilitation facility, therefore you will need to have 24 hour\\nsupervision at home.\\n\\nYou were also seen by our psychiatry team and neurology team for\\nyour extreme agitation.  This was likely due to alcohol\\nwithdrawal.  You were treated with medications for this, and\\nafter extubation, your mental status slowly improved.\\n\\nPlease take all your medications as prescribed.  Please go to\\nall appointments as scheduled.  Please refrain from alcohol or\\ntobacco use as these both may increase your [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] pressure.\\n\\nIf you develop any of the following concerning symptoms, please\\ncall your PCP or go to the ED: chest pain, shortness of breath,\\nabdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, inability to tolerate\\noral food/liquids, leg pains, cold feet, or blue toes/fingers.\\n\\nFollowup Instructions:\\nYou have an apointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital on Tuesday Februray 12th [**2146**] at 2:40pm.\\n\\nYou have an apointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 74636**] on [**11-9**] at\\n3:30pm at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital .\\n\\nPlease choose a primary care physician to see in [**Location (un) 5503**] for\\na follow up apointment within the next 2-4 weeks.\\n\\n\\n   \n",
