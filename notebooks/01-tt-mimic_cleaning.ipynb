On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded\\nregion within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9\\nmm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may\\nrepresent an unusual focus of red marrow. No sclerosis is seen\\non the corresponding plain films. There is a small right hip\\njoint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint\\nas well, at the upper limits of normal. There is no soft tissue\\nabnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.\\nIMPRESSION: 1. Small right hip joint effusion. 2. No bone marrow\\nedema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis. 3. Nonspecific small\\nfocus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral\\nhead is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red\\nmarrow.\\n\\nTTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is\\nsevere symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\\nventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular\\nwall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is\\nhyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18 mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is\\nidentified. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\\nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally\\nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The\\nincreased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac\\noutput. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no\\nsystolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)\\nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\\nsystolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.\\nThe effusion appears circumferential. There are no\\nechocardiographic signs of tamponade.\\nIMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\\nhyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient.\\nMild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.\\nFindings consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**],\\npulmonary hypertension has developed (also present on the study\\nfrom [**2140-5-20**]). Pericardial effusion is also new.\\n\\nV/Q scan ([**9-21**]): Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol\\nin 8 views demonstrate no focal defects with improved\\nventilation to the posterior right basal segment.  Perfusion\\nimages in the same 8 views show improved perfusion to the\\nposterior right basal segement with a persistent small defect\\nbut no new findings.\\nChest x-ray shows cardiomgealy and left basilar atelectasis.\\nIMPRESSION: Improved V/Q scan from [**9-/2139**] with no findings to\\nsuggest acute pulmonary embolism.\\n\\nB/L upper ext U/S ([**9-21**]): Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of\\nthe\\nright and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,\\nbasilic and cephalic veins were performed. There is nonocclusive\\nfocal thrombus seen in the left subclavian vein, where the vein\\nis not fully compressible. Flow is seen in the region,\\nindicating that the thrombus is nonocclusive. Elsewhere, normal\\nflow, augmentation, compressibility were appropriate and\\nwaveforms are demonstrated.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. Focal nonocclusive thrombus in the left subclavian vein.\\n2.

Patient was on the floor on [**9-20**],\\ngiven morphine for the hip pain.  She then had an episode of\\nhypotension and unresponsiveness and transferred to the MICU for\\ncloser monitoring. The patient got 2L IVFs and narcan and\\nimproved, in fact, found to be hypertensive upon arrival to\\nMICU.\\n.\\nMICU Course: On [**9-20**], the patient triggered for hypotension\\n(82/45), hypothermia (92.9) and altered mental status with\\ndifficult arousability in setting of recent blood transfusion.\\nConcern was for sepsis, autonomic seizure, transfusion reaction,\\npulmonary embolus and/or narcosis.  Mental status cleared\\nsomewhat with narcan. Renal c/s felt episode likely [**2-11**]\\naccumulation of morphine active metabolites. V/Q scan\\ndemonstrated improvement since prior study. Patient's home\\nprednisone dose was increased from 5 to 15mg with thought that\\npatient may be stressed in setting of acute illness. She was\\nfebrile on [**9-21**] and resultingly started in vancomycin,\\naztreonam, and levofloxacin. PD fluid was not c/w SBP. CXR was\\nclear. Urine culture and blood cultures are pending. Patient's\\nBP was in the 110s so hydralazine was stopped. Her other BP meds\\nwere otherwise continued.  Plan was/is to follow renal recs for\\nPD. If, in 24-48 hours (once cultures have had 48-72 hours to\\ngrow) no source has been located, would d/c antibiotics except\\nfor levofloxacin.  Would continue levoflox for total 5 day\\ncourse for pneumonia possibly ? aspiration pneumonitis during\\nepisode of altered mental status.  If patient has leg pain\\nagain, may consider neurogenic source such a piriformis syndrome\\nas suggested by neurology. Would add neurontin 100mg TID with\\nroom to titrate up to 300mg TID. Neuro also recommended PT with\\nTENS unit and referral to pain clinic although patient's pain is\\ncurrently absent.\\n.\\nFYI **** per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] --- Because of ? increase in\\ncardiomegaly on CXR, she got an echo yesterday.  In addition to\\nher known HOCM, this showed (1) a small pericardial effusion,\\nand (2) pulmonary hypertension with an estimated tricuspid\\ngradient of 50 mm Hg. They probably need to be followed up over\\ntime (particularly the pulmonary hypertension).  We did\\nevaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making\\nchronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.\\nIt would be good if we could arrange a PULMONARY CLINIC FOLLOW\\nUP for Ms. [**Known lastname **] after discharge with either [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].****\\n\\n.\\nShe underwent CT head, and V/Q scan which were unremarkable.\\nHer steroid dose was increased to 15mg given concern for need\\nfor stress dose steroids. After transfer from the MICU, her\\nsteroids were dropped back to 5mg, her home dose with the\\napproval of [**Last Name (un) **].\\n.\\nHer hypotensive episode was thought to be due to a delayed\\nclearing of the morphine due to her renal failure.  Her\\nhydralazine was discontinued.  On day 2 of her MICU stay, she\\ndeveloped a fever to 102.  She was pan-cultured (blood, urine,\\nperitoneal dialysate) without obvious source of infection.\\nBroad spectrum abx were started (vanco, cipro, aztreonam (pcn\\nallergy)) empirically.  There was question of retrocardiac\\nopacity on CXR, though not clear. Rheum consult obtained given\\nhip discomfort, who felt septic joint unlikely.  Neurology\\nconsult obtained who felt autonomic seizure unlikely.\\n.\\nPt initiated peritoneal dialysis.  In this setting she has been\\nhaving some nausea, which has made taking her home labetalol\\ndifficult, resulting in some rising BPs.  She is called out to\\nmedical service for ongoing management and workup of fever,\\nnausea, and hypertension.  Her hip pain has resolved completely\\nwithout further intervention.\\n.\\nFloor course:\\nFever: Spike fever in MICU to 102. Started on Levoquin,\\nAztreonam, and Vanc. Source unclear at this point, but CXR with\\nquestion of retrocardiac opacity. There is a possibility of\\naspiration pneumonitis. Other etiologies include peritoneal\\nfluid (PD cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have\\nany indwelling lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be\\nseptic arthritis but no pain with movement on exam makes this\\nless likely. Peritoneal dialysis cultures negative so far.\\nContinued levo/vanco/aztreonam for 2 days empirically. Then\\nd/ced the Abx as no infectious etiologies were found. Steroids\\nback to home dosage. BCx, UCx (final neg), Peritoneal cultures\\nnegative at discharge.\\n.\\n# Labile blood pressure: h/o of difficult to control BP with\\nepisodes of hypertensive emergency in the past. Normal SBP runs\\nin 170s. Having nausea in setting of new PD, no evidence of\\nintracranial bleeding on clinical exam, though INR had been\\nsupratherapeutic so remains in differential, though not\\nbradycardic. Continue home BP meds :Labetalol 900 mg PO TID but\\ndifficult for patient to tolerate due to nausea, Aliskiren *NF*\\n150 mg Oral [**Hospital1 **], NIFEdipine CR 60 mg PO DAILY, clonidine patch,\\nhydralazine given hypertensive in setting of nausa.\\n.\\n# Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or\\nfracture on MRI though there is a small effusion. Pain resolved\\nwithout intervention. Continued to monitor\\nand would avoid narcotics, restart slowly if pain resumes.\\nPhysical therapy to follow as an outpatient. [**Last Name (un) 18183**] followed.\\nPlease see consult note.\\n.\\n# Hyperkalemia: Chronic issue. Patient takes kayexalate\\nintermittently per her report (last dose [**Last Name (un) 766**]). Monitored K\\nbut patient did not need it on floor.\\n\\n# CKD V: Renal following. Did well with PD on [**9-22**] but did\\nreport some nause and cramping. She was not tolerating all 1.5L\\nin exchanges on discharge.\\n\\n# Anemia: Hct stable around 20. S/p 1 U PRBCs in MICU with Hct\\n20.1 to 21.9. Likely due to chronic hemolysis consistent with\\nSLE&gt;\\n\\n#. Prior SVC thrombus: Physical exam with L arm swelling\\nconsistent with this. No flow limitations. INR 3.5 on ICU\\nadmission. Held warfarin but restarted home 2mg daily the day\\nbefore discharge.\\n\\n# Systemic lupus erythematosus: Home prednisone dose 5mg.\\nCurrently on 15mg in setting of acute illness (day 2).\\n\\n# General care: FEN: low sodium, renal diet; treatment of\\nhyperkalemia as above, replete other lytes prn, PD initiated,\\nProph: INR therapeutic, no indication for PPI, kayexalate as\\nneeded for hyperkalemia and lactulose prn as per home regimen.\\nCode: Full code, confirmed with patient Communication: with the\\npatient and her mother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], [**Telephone/Fax (2) 43497**]contact.

The patient was seen and evaluated in the MICU by the CCU\\nteam prior to transfer. The patient was transferred in a guarded\\ncondition.\\n.\\nHospital Course By System:\\n   1. Vascular: Patient was initially admitted to the vascular\\nservice. He was evaluated and it was determined that surgical\\nintervention in his case is not warranted at this time. His\\nmanagement has consisted of [**Month/Day/Year **] pressure control, and\\nmonitoring for signs of vascular compromise. Initial management\\nof hypertension required multiple PO medications in combination\\nwith IV antihypertensives. Initially due to the rising creatine\\nin the setting of vascular compromise to one or both kidneys,\\nACEi and ARBs were held due to concern about further\\nhypoperfusion to the kidney. Renal medicine was consulted on\\n[**9-27**] and approved the use of an ACEi. The patient responded\\nwell to this and was able to remove all IV antihypertensive\\nmedications. His pressure has remained stable with occasional\\nelevations in systolic [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures related to agitation in\\nperiods of light sedation. Quality of pulses were followed and\\nsaw improvement in right lower extremety pulses over his\\nhospitalization. Lactate levels were drawn along with serial\\nabdominal exams to evaluate for signs of bowel ischemia. He was\\nguaiac negative and had no other signs of acute bowel ischemia.\\nExtremeties remained warm with good capillary refill. Creatine\\nstabilized with a maximum value of 2.1 on hospital day 12.  On\\ndischarge the creatinine had trended down to 1.2.  No signs of\\nacute ischemic injury to the carotid arteries. During physical\\ntherapy and daily ambulation, he denies any claudication or\\nnumbness to either legs. Renal perfusion scan performed on [**10-5**]\\nshowed 29% function in the right kidney and 71% of renal\\nfunction performed by the left kidney. Pt was slowly weaned off\\nbp medications as his agitation and kidney function improved.\\nHe was discharged on Propanolol 160mg [**Hospital1 **], Amlodipine 10mg\\ndaily, and Lisinopril 10mg po bid for [**Hospital1 **] pressure management.\\nHe will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Cardiology and Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient will make a follow up appointment with a\\nPCP in the [**Location (un) 5503**] area.  On discharge pt's bllod pressure\\nwas [**Last Name (un) 74635**] well controlled at 110s/70s.\\n.\\n   2. Respiratory: Patient was initially intubated on [**9-16**] for\\nincreasing agitation and poor [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure control secondary\\nto the agitation. During the first days of the admission, he\\nbecame increasingly agitated and at time of intubation, required\\n4 security guards to restrain him for his own safety. He was\\ninitially started on AC but switched to SIMV+PS as tolerated. On\\n[**9-18**] chest x-ray showed signs of a right middle lobe\\ninfiltrate. He was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxican, and\\nZosyn for broad coverage. Culture results indicated the presence\\nof streptococcus pneumoniae (oxacillin sensitive) and Moraxella\\nCatastalsis. Antibiotic regimen was changed to Zosyn only and\\ndosed appropriately for renal function. Patient completed the 10\\nday course on [**9-30**]. Ventilator settings were decreased as\\ntolerated in anticipation of weaning the ventilator and the\\npatient was successfully extubated on [**9-30**]. Repeat CXRs showed\\ngradual improvement in lung function and resolving infiltrates.\\nPatient had spiked another fever on [**9-30**] with worsening CXR and\\nnoted infiltrates. He was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime\\nfor 7 day course. At time of discharge there were no respiratory\\nissues and pt had remained afebrile without a oxygen requirement\\nduring ambulation as well as at rest.\\n.\\n  3. DVT: On [**9-20**] the patient's right arm was disproportantly\\nlarger and firm compared to the left arm. The patient underwent\\na duplex ultrasound which showed non obstructing DVT in the\\naxillary vein not extending to the subclavian. PICC line in the\\nright AC was removed. The patient was not a candidate for\\nanticoagulation due to his other issues and was followed\\nclinically with no further complications with a resolution of\\nthe swelling in his arm prior to d/c.\\n.\\n  4. Pain Control / Sedation: Patient was initially started on\\npropofol in the MICU and switched to Dexmedetomidine with\\nDilaudid bolus PRN. On transfer to the CCU he was switched to\\nVersed and Fentanyl. During his admission, he required\\nincreasing doses of sedative with frequent boluses. On Hospital\\nday 13 he was started on Methadone as an alternative to\\nFentanyl. He also was switched to PRN boluses of Ativan instead\\nwith good control. For further sedation, he was started on\\nstanding does of Haldol with good result. After extubation,\\nsedation and pain control was titrated down to patient comfort\\nand the patient's mental status improved. Neurology was\\nconsulted for evaluation of mental status. As the patient's\\ncognition improved with time and removal of sedating medication,\\nthe recommendation was an EEG which showed diffuse slowing\\nconsistent with a toxic/metabolic picture. Patient's mental\\nstatus improved with the removal of all sedating medications. At\\ntime of discharge he was able to make appropriate cognitive\\ndecisions and was believed to be able to manage his care at\\nhome. Patient was cleared to go home by Occupational Therapy and\\nwas discharged home in a stable condition.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nNone\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

You will need to followup with them in clinic.\\n\\nYou were also seen by the Renal service for your worsening\\nkidney function due to your aortic dissection.  Prior to\\ndischarge, your kidney function had markedly improved.\\n\\nYou were also seen by our physical therapists who felt that you\\nwould benefit from 24 hour supervision initially and\\nrehabilitation.  You did not want to go to an inpatient\\nrehabilitation facility, therefore you will need to have 24 hour\\nsupervision at home.\\n\\nYou were also seen by our psychiatry team and neurology team for\\nyour extreme agitation.  This was likely due to alcohol\\nwithdrawal.  You were treated with medications for this, and\\nafter extubation, your mental status slowly improved.\\n\\nPlease take all your medications as prescribed.

On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded\\nregion within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9\\nmm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may\\nrepresent an unusual focus of red marrow. No sclerosis is seen\\non the corresponding plain films. There is a small right hip\\njoint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint\\nas well, at the upper limits of normal. There is no soft tissue\\nabnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.\\nIMPRESSION: 1. Small right hip joint effusion. 2. No bone marrow\\nedema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis. 3. Nonspecific small\\nfocus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral\\nhead is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red\\nmarrow.\\n\\nTTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is\\nsevere symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\\nventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular\\nwall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is\\nhyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18 mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is\\nidentified. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\\nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally\\nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The\\nincreased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac\\noutput. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no\\nsystolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)\\nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\\nsystolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.\\nThe effusion appears circumferential. There are no\\nechocardiographic signs of tamponade.\\nIMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\\nhyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient.\\nMild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.\\nFindings consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**],\\npulmonary hypertension has developed (also present on the study\\nfrom [**2140-5-20**]). Pericardial effusion is also new.\\n\\nV/Q scan ([**9-21**]): Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol\\nin 8 views demonstrate no focal defects with improved\\nventilation to the posterior right basal segment.  Perfusion\\nimages in the same 8 views show improved perfusion to the\\nposterior right basal segement with a persistent small defect\\nbut no new findings.\\nChest x-ray shows cardiomgealy and left basilar atelectasis.\\nIMPRESSION: Improved V/Q scan from [**9-/2139**] with no findings to\\nsuggest acute pulmonary embolism.\\n\\nB/L upper ext U/S ([**9-21**]): Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of\\nthe\\nright and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,\\nbasilic and cephalic veins were performed. There is nonocclusive\\nfocal thrombus seen in the left subclavian vein, where the vein\\nis not fully compressible. Flow is seen in the region,\\nindicating that the thrombus is nonocclusive. Elsewhere, normal\\nflow, augmentation, compressibility were appropriate and\\nwaveforms are demonstrated.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. Focal nonocclusive thrombus in the left subclavian vein.\\n2.

Patient was on the floor on [**9-20**],\\ngiven morphine for the hip pain.  She then had an episode of\\nhypotension and unresponsiveness and transferred to the MICU for\\ncloser monitoring. The patient got 2L IVFs and narcan and\\nimproved, in fact, found to be hypertensive upon arrival to\\nMICU.\\n.\\nMICU Course: On [**9-20**], the patient triggered for hypotension\\n(82/45), hypothermia (92.9) and altered mental status with\\ndifficult arousability in setting of recent blood transfusion.\\nConcern was for sepsis, autonomic seizure, transfusion reaction,\\npulmonary embolus and/or narcosis.  Mental status cleared\\nsomewhat with narcan. Renal c/s felt episode likely [**2-11**]\\naccumulation of morphine active metabolites. V/Q scan\\ndemonstrated improvement since prior study. Patient's home\\nprednisone dose was increased from 5 to 15mg with thought that\\npatient may be stressed in setting of acute illness. She was\\nfebrile on [**9-21**] and resultingly started in vancomycin,\\naztreonam, and levofloxacin. PD fluid was not c/w SBP. CXR was\\nclear. Urine culture and blood cultures are pending. Patient's\\nBP was in the 110s so hydralazine was stopped. Her other BP meds\\nwere otherwise continued.  Plan was/is to follow renal recs for\\nPD. If, in 24-48 hours (once cultures have had 48-72 hours to\\ngrow) no source has been located, would d/c antibiotics except\\nfor levofloxacin.  Would continue levoflox for total 5 day\\ncourse for pneumonia possibly ? aspiration pneumonitis during\\nepisode of altered mental status.  If patient has leg pain\\nagain, may consider neurogenic source such a piriformis syndrome\\nas suggested by neurology. Would add neurontin 100mg TID with\\nroom to titrate up to 300mg TID. Neuro also recommended PT with\\nTENS unit and referral to pain clinic although patient's pain is\\ncurrently absent.\\n.\\nFYI **** per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] --- Because of ? increase in\\ncardiomegaly on CXR, she got an echo yesterday.  In addition to\\nher known HOCM, this showed (1) a small pericardial effusion,\\nand (2) pulmonary hypertension with an estimated tricuspid\\ngradient of 50 mm Hg. They probably need to be followed up over\\ntime (particularly the pulmonary hypertension).  We did\\nevaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making\\nchronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.\\nIt would be good if we could arrange a PULMONARY CLINIC FOLLOW\\nUP for Ms. [**Known lastname **] after discharge with either [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].****\\n\\n.\\nShe underwent CT head, and V/Q scan which were unremarkable.\\nHer steroid dose was increased to 15mg given concern for need\\nfor stress dose steroids. After transfer from the MICU, her\\nsteroids were dropped back to 5mg, her home dose with the\\napproval of [**Last Name (un) **].\\n.\\nHer hypotensive episode was thought to be due to a delayed\\nclearing of the morphine due to her renal failure.  Her\\nhydralazine was discontinued.  On day 2 of her MICU stay, she\\ndeveloped a fever to 102.  She was pan-cultured (blood, urine,\\nperitoneal dialysate) without obvious source of infection.\\nBroad spectrum abx were started (vanco, cipro, aztreonam (pcn\\nallergy)) empirically.  There was question of retrocardiac\\nopacity on CXR, though not clear. Rheum consult obtained given\\nhip discomfort, who felt septic joint unlikely.  Neurology\\nconsult obtained who felt autonomic seizure unlikely.\\n.\\nPt initiated peritoneal dialysis.  In this setting she has been\\nhaving some nausea, which has made taking her home labetalol\\ndifficult, resulting in some rising BPs.  She is called out to\\nmedical service for ongoing management and workup of fever,\\nnausea, and hypertension.  Her hip pain has resolved completely\\nwithout further intervention.\\n.\\nFloor course:\\nFever: Spike fever in MICU to 102. Started on Levoquin,\\nAztreonam, and Vanc. Source unclear at this point, but CXR with\\nquestion of retrocardiac opacity. There is a possibility of\\naspiration pneumonitis. Other etiologies include peritoneal\\nfluid (PD cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have\\nany indwelling lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be\\nseptic arthritis but no pain with movement on exam makes this\\nless likely. Peritoneal dialysis cultures negative so far.\\nContinued levo/vanco/aztreonam for 2 days empirically. Then\\nd/ced the Abx as no infectious etiologies were found. Steroids\\nback to home dosage. BCx, UCx (final neg), Peritoneal cultures\\nnegative at discharge.\\n.\\n# Labile blood pressure: h/o of difficult to control BP with\\nepisodes of hypertensive emergency in the past. Normal SBP runs\\nin 170s. Having nausea in setting of new PD, no evidence of\\nintracranial bleeding on clinical exam, though INR had been\\nsupratherapeutic so remains in differential, though not\\nbradycardic. Continue home BP meds :Labetalol 900 mg PO TID but\\ndifficult for patient to tolerate due to nausea, Aliskiren *NF*\\n150 mg Oral [**Hospital1 **], NIFEdipine CR 60 mg PO DAILY, clonidine patch,\\nhydralazine given hypertensive in setting of nausa.\\n.\\n# Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or\\nfracture on MRI though there is a small effusion. Pain resolved\\nwithout intervention. Continued to monitor\\nand would avoid narcotics, restart slowly if pain resumes.\\nPhysical therapy to follow as an outpatient.

Extremity examination shows right\\nextremity is warm and left extremity proximal to the medial\\nmalleolus with 3 by 4 ulceration with surrounding erythema\\nand cellulitis.  Pulse examination shows palpable femorals\\nbilaterally with palpable popliteals bilaterally.  The right\\ndorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse were\\ndopplerable and the left dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior\\ntibial pulse were dopplerable.\\n\\nLABORATORY:  CBC with a white blood cell count of 20.1,\\nhematocrit 29.7, platelets 62K, BUN 12, creatinine 0.6, K\\n3.6.  [**Name (NI) 2591**] PT/INR 16.5 and 1.9, PTT 35.  Chest x-ray was no\\nactive cardiopulmonary disease.  Electrocardiogram showed no\\nevidence of ischemia and normal sinus rhythm with a rate of\\n81.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Vascular\\nService.  He was continued on his preadmission medications\\nincluding Unasyn 1.5 grams q 6 hours.  Surgical dressings\\nwere normal saline and wet to dry dressings b.i.d. to the\\neffected ulcer site.  The patient underwent venous duplexes\\non [**2190-6-8**] to asses for vein conduit for bypass grafting.  The\\npatient underwent on [**2190-6-6**] an arteriogram, which\\ndemonstrated a gradient across the aortic to the common iliac\\non the left with a 12 mm gradient.  Along the common iliac\\nthere was more gradient of 180 mg across the stent.  It was\\n156 mm with stenosis at the distal start and an occluded left\\nsuperficial femoral artery popliteal.  The AT refilled below\\nthe fibular head and was open all the way to the dorsalis\\npedis pulses.  The patient tolerated the arteriogram.  PICC\\nlines were attempted to provide intravenous access, but the\\nveins were too small and this was aborted.\\n\\nThe patient had an arterial blood gas done in preparation for\\nrevascularization of his lower leg, pH was 7.51, PO2 61, PCO2\\nwas 36, CO2 30, base excess 5.  The patient underwent on\\n[**2190-6-11**] a left femoral AT bypass graft to the PTFE.  He\\ntolerated the procedure well.  He was transferred to the PACU\\nin stable condition.  Immediate postoperative check he was\\nhemodynamically stable.  Postoperatively, hematocrit was\\n32.4, PTT 84.8, BUN 6, creatinine 0.6.  His extremity was\\nwarm with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse and absent patient.\\nHe continued to do well and was transferred to the VICU.\\nPostoperative day one there were no overnight events.  He\\ncontinued on Vancomycin, Levo and Flagyl.  His diet was\\nadvanced as tolerated.  He required Lasix to diurese.  He was\\nD-lined and transferred to the regular nursing floor.  On [**6-14**]\\nthe patient underwent debridement of the left ankle\\nulceration he tolerated the procedure well and was\\ntransferred to the regular nursing floor.  Coumadin was begun\\non 3 mg per day, ambulation was instituted.  A request for\\nPICC line was requested, but this could not be done.  He was\\ncontinued on his antibiotics and the Foley was discontinued\\nand rehab screening was begun.\\n\\nPhysical therapy saw the patient and recommended short term\\nrehabilitation to improve his mobility and gait.  A reattempt\\nwill be made to place the PICC line at the bedside.  If this\\nis unable to be done, then it will be done in interventional\\nradiology.  He will continue on his antibiotics for a total\\nof two more weeks post discharge.\\n\\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  He is to follow up with Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks time.  Goal INR is 2.0 to 2.5.  INR\\nshould be monitored until the patient has reached the steady\\ntherapeutic state.  Coumadin should be adjusted to maintain\\nINR goal.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Folic acid 1 mg q.d., calcium\\ncarbonate 500 mg q.d., multivitamin tablet one q.d.,\\nSimvastatin 10 mg q.d., magnesium oxide 400 mg q.d.,\\nAlbuterol puff one to two q 6 hours prn, Ipratropium bromide\\npuffs 2 inhalers q.i.d., Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. hold for\\nsystolic blood pressure less then 100 and heart rate less\\nthen 60.

The patient was seen and evaluated in the MICU by the CCU\\nteam prior to transfer. The patient was transferred in a guarded\\ncondition.\\n.\\nHospital Course By System:\\n   1. Vascular: Patient was initially admitted to the vascular\\nservice. He was evaluated and it was determined that surgical\\nintervention in his case is not warranted at this time. His\\nmanagement has consisted of [**Month/Day/Year **] pressure control, and\\nmonitoring for signs of vascular compromise. Initial management\\nof hypertension required multiple PO medications in combination\\nwith IV antihypertensives. Initially due to the rising creatine\\nin the setting of vascular compromise to one or both kidneys,\\nACEi and ARBs were held due to concern about further\\nhypoperfusion to the kidney. Renal medicine was consulted on\\n[**9-27**] and approved the use of an ACEi. The patient responded\\nwell to this and was able to remove all IV antihypertensive\\nmedications. His pressure has remained stable with occasional\\nelevations in systolic [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures related to agitation in\\nperiods of light sedation. Quality of pulses were followed and\\nsaw improvement in right lower extremety pulses over his\\nhospitalization. Lactate levels were drawn along with serial\\nabdominal exams to evaluate for signs of bowel ischemia. He was\\nguaiac negative and had no other signs of acute bowel ischemia.\\nExtremeties remained warm with good capillary refill. Creatine\\nstabilized with a maximum value of 2.1 on hospital day 12.  On\\ndischarge the creatinine had trended down to 1.2.  No signs of\\nacute ischemic injury to the carotid arteries. During physical\\ntherapy and daily ambulation, he denies any claudication or\\nnumbness to either legs. Renal perfusion scan performed on [**10-5**]\\nshowed 29% function in the right kidney and 71% of renal\\nfunction performed by the left kidney. Pt was slowly weaned off\\nbp medications as his agitation and kidney function improved.\\nHe was discharged on Propanolol 160mg [**Hospital1 **], Amlodipine 10mg\\ndaily, and Lisinopril 10mg po bid for [**Hospital1 **] pressure management.\\nHe will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Cardiology and Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient will make a follow up appointment with a\\nPCP in the [**Location (un) 5503**] area.  On discharge pt's bllod pressure\\nwas [**Last Name (un) 74635**] well controlled at 110s/70s.\\n.\\n   2. Respiratory: Patient was initially intubated on [**9-16**] for\\nincreasing agitation and poor [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure control secondary\\nto the agitation. During the first days of the admission, he\\nbecame increasingly agitated and at time of intubation, required\\n4 security guards to restrain him for his own safety. He was\\ninitially started on AC but switched to SIMV+PS as tolerated. On\\n[**9-18**] chest x-ray showed signs of a right middle lobe\\ninfiltrate. He was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxican, and\\nZosyn for broad coverage. Culture results indicated the presence\\nof streptococcus pneumoniae (oxacillin sensitive) and Moraxella\\nCatastalsis. Antibiotic regimen was changed to Zosyn only and\\ndosed appropriately for renal function. Patient completed the 10\\nday course on [**9-30**]. Ventilator settings were decreased as\\ntolerated in anticipation of weaning the ventilator and the\\npatient was successfully extubated on [**9-30**]. Repeat CXRs showed\\ngradual improvement in lung function and resolving infiltrates.\\nPatient had spiked another fever on [**9-30**] with worsening CXR and\\nnoted infiltrates. He was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime\\nfor 7 day course. At time of discharge there were no respiratory\\nissues and pt had remained afebrile without a oxygen requirement\\nduring ambulation as well as at rest.\\n.\\n  3. DVT: On [**9-20**] the patient's right arm was disproportantly\\nlarger and firm compared to the left arm. The patient underwent\\na duplex ultrasound which showed non obstructing DVT in the\\naxillary vein not extending to the subclavian. PICC line in the\\nright AC was removed. The patient was not a candidate for\\nanticoagulation due to his other issues and was followed\\nclinically with no further complications with a resolution of\\nthe swelling in his arm prior to d/c.\\n.\\n  4. Pain Control / Sedation: Patient was initially started on\\npropofol in the MICU and switched to Dexmedetomidine with\\nDilaudid bolus PRN. On transfer to the CCU he was switched to\\nVersed and Fentanyl. During his admission, he required\\nincreasing doses of sedative with frequent boluses. On Hospital\\nday 13 he was started on Methadone as an alternative to\\nFentanyl. He also was switched to PRN boluses of Ativan instead\\nwith good control. For further sedation, he was started on\\nstanding does of Haldol with good result. After extubation,\\nsedation and pain control was titrated down to patient comfort\\nand the patient's mental status improved. Neurology was\\nconsulted for evaluation of mental status. As the patient's\\ncognition improved with time and removal of sedating medication,\\nthe recommendation was an EEG which showed diffuse slowing\\nconsistent with a toxic/metabolic picture. Patient's mental\\nstatus improved with the removal of all sedating medications. At\\ntime of discharge he was able to make appropriate cognitive\\ndecisions and was believed to be able to manage his care at\\nhome. Patient was cleared to go home by Occupational Therapy and\\nwas discharged home in a stable condition.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nNone\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1. Lisinopril 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\\nday).\\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\\n2.

This is a condition\\nwhere the large artery that runs through your chest and abdomen\\nhas split into two seperate openings that can cause problems\\nwith [**Name2 (NI) **] flow to organs such as intestines and Kidneys. The\\nbest treatment for your type of disection is to keep your [**Name2 (NI) **]\\npressure below 120/80 with medications. You will need to limit\\nthe amount of salt in yor diet and follow up with a primary care\\nprovider of your choosing and a cardologist at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].\\nIf you start having worsening chest pains, discomfort in your\\nlegs while walking, or problems thinking clearly you should\\nvisit your local emergency room for treatment.\\n.\\nYou were seen by cardiothoracic surgery as well as vascular\\nsurgery.  You will need to followup with them in clinic.\\n\\nYou were also seen by the Renal service for your worsening\\nkidney function due to your aortic dissection.  Prior to\\ndischarge, your kidney function had markedly improved.\\n\\nYou were also seen by our physical therapists who felt that you\\nwould benefit from 24 hour supervision initially and\\nrehabilitation.  You did not want to go to an inpatient\\nrehabilitation facility, therefore you will need to have 24 hour\\nsupervision at home.\\n\\nYou were also seen by our psychiatry team and neurology team for\\nyour extreme agitation.  This was likely due to alcohol\\nwithdrawal.  You were treated with medications for this, and\\nafter extubation, your mental status slowly improved.\\n\\nPlease take all your medications as prescribed.  Please go to\\nall appointments as scheduled.  Please refrain from alcohol or\\ntobacco use as these both may increase your [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] pressure.\\n\\nIf you develop any of the following concerning symptoms, please\\ncall your PCP or go to the ED: chest pain, shortness of breath,\\nabdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, inability to tolerate\\noral food/liquids, leg pains, cold feet, or blue toes/fingers.\\n\\nFollowup Instructions:\\nYou have an apointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital on Tuesday Februray 12th [**2146**] at 2:40pm.\\n\\nYou have an apointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 74636**] on [**11-9**] at\\n3:30pm at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital .\\n\\nPlease choose a primary care physician to see in [**Location (un) 5503**] for\\na follow up apointment within the next 2-4 weeks.\\n\\n\\n   \n",

On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded\\nregion within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9\\nmm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may\\nrepresent an unusual focus of red marrow. No sclerosis is seen\\non the corresponding plain films. There is a small right hip\\njoint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint\\nas well, at the upper limits of normal. There is no soft tissue\\nabnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.\\nIMPRESSION: 1. Small right hip joint effusion. 2. No bone marrow\\nedema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis. 3. Nonspecific small\\nfocus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral\\nhead is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red\\nmarrow.\\n\\nTTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is\\nsevere symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\\nventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular\\nwall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is\\nhyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18 mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is\\nidentified. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\\nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally\\nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The\\nincreased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac\\noutput. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no\\nsystolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)\\nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\\nsystolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.\\nThe effusion appears circumferential. There are no\\nechocardiographic signs of tamponade.\\nIMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\\nhyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient.\\nMild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.\\nFindings consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**],\\npulmonary hypertension has developed (also present on the study\\nfrom [**2140-5-20**]). Pericardial effusion is also new.\\n\\nV/Q scan ([**9-21**]): Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol\\nin 8 views demonstrate no focal defects with improved\\nventilation to the posterior right basal segment.  Perfusion\\nimages in the same 8 views show improved perfusion to the\\nposterior right basal segement with a persistent small defect\\nbut no new findings.\\nChest x-ray shows cardiomgealy and left basilar atelectasis.\\nIMPRESSION: Improved V/Q scan from [**9-/2139**] with no findings to\\nsuggest acute pulmonary embolism.\\n\\nB/L upper ext U/S ([**9-21**]): Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of\\nthe\\nright and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,\\nbasilic and cephalic veins were performed. There is nonocclusive\\nfocal thrombus seen in the left subclavian vein, where the vein\\nis not fully compressible. Flow is seen in the region,\\nindicating that the thrombus is nonocclusive. Elsewhere, normal\\nflow, augmentation, compressibility were appropriate and\\nwaveforms are demonstrated.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. Focal nonocclusive thrombus in the left subclavian vein.\\n2. Otherwise, patent upper extremity veins as described.\\n\\n[**2141-9-18**] 02:15PM   POTASSIUM-5.1\\n[**2141-9-18**] 02:15PM   HCT-21.2*\\n[**2141-9-18**] 08:45AM   POTASSIUM-5.7*\\n[**2141-9-18**] 07:30AM   GLUCOSE-88 UREA N-54* CREAT-8.6* SODIUM-136\\nPOTASSIUM-5.8* CHLORIDE-108 TOTAL CO2-15* ANION GAP-19\\n[**2141-9-18**] 07:30AM   estGFR-Using this\\n[**2141-9-18**] 07:30AM   CALCIUM-7.3* PHOSPHATE-5.3* MAGNESIUM-1.6\\n[**2141-9-18**] 07:30AM   WBC-5.2 RBC-2.32* HGB-6.5* HCT-20.1* MCV-87\\nMCH-28.1 MCHC-32.4 RDW-18.4*\\n[**2141-9-18**] 07:30AM   NEUTS-78.0* LYMPHS-14.7* MONOS-3.9 EOS-3.2\\nBASOS-0.3\\n[**2141-9-18**] 07:30AM   PLT COUNT-107*\\n[**2141-9-18**] 07:30AM   PT-20.8* PTT-43.3* INR(PT)-2.0*\\n.\\n[**2141-9-21**] CXR:\\nThere is no significant change when compared to the recent\\nprevious\\nexamination.\\nThe previously described left retrocardiac opacity is unchanged\\nin appearance.\\nCardiomegaly is also unchanged.

The patient got 2L IVFs and narcan and\\nimproved, in fact, found to be hypertensive upon arrival to\\nMICU.\\n.\\nMICU Course: On [**9-20**], the patient triggered for hypotension\\n(82/45), hypothermia (92.9) and altered mental status with\\ndifficult arousability in setting of recent blood transfusion.\\nConcern was for sepsis, autonomic seizure, transfusion reaction,\\npulmonary embolus and/or narcosis.  Mental status cleared\\nsomewhat with narcan. Renal c/s felt episode likely [**2-11**]\\naccumulation of morphine active metabolites. V/Q scan\\ndemonstrated improvement since prior study. Patient's home\\nprednisone dose was increased from 5 to 15mg with thought that\\npatient may be stressed in setting of acute illness. She was\\nfebrile on [**9-21**] and resultingly started in vancomycin,\\naztreonam, and levofloxacin. PD fluid was not c/w SBP. CXR was\\nclear. Urine culture and blood cultures are pending. Patient's\\nBP was in the 110s so hydralazine was stopped. Her other BP meds\\nwere otherwise continued.  Plan was/is to follow renal recs for\\nPD. If, in 24-48 hours (once cultures have had 48-72 hours to\\ngrow) no source has been located, would d/c antibiotics except\\nfor levofloxacin.  Would continue levoflox for total 5 day\\ncourse for pneumonia possibly ? aspiration pneumonitis during\\nepisode of altered mental status.  If patient has leg pain\\nagain, may consider neurogenic source such a piriformis syndrome\\nas suggested by neurology. Would add neurontin 100mg TID with\\nroom to titrate up to 300mg TID. Neuro also recommended PT with\\nTENS unit and referral to pain clinic although patient's pain is\\ncurrently absent.\\n.\\nFYI **** per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] --- Because of ? increase in\\ncardiomegaly on CXR, she got an echo yesterday.  In addition to\\nher known HOCM, this showed (1) a small pericardial effusion,\\nand (2) pulmonary hypertension with an estimated tricuspid\\ngradient of 50 mm Hg. They probably need to be followed up over\\ntime (particularly the pulmonary hypertension).  We did\\nevaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making\\nchronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.\\nIt would be good if we could arrange a PULMONARY CLINIC FOLLOW\\nUP for Ms. [**Known lastname **] after discharge with either [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].****\\n\\n.\\nShe underwent CT head, and V/Q scan which were unremarkable.\\nHer steroid dose was increased to 15mg given concern for need\\nfor stress dose steroids. After transfer from the MICU, her\\nsteroids were dropped back to 5mg, her home dose with the\\napproval of [**Last Name (un) **].\\n.\\nHer hypotensive episode was thought to be due to a delayed\\nclearing of the morphine due to her renal failure.  Her\\nhydralazine was discontinued.  On day 2 of her MICU stay, she\\ndeveloped a fever to 102.  She was pan-cultured (blood, urine,\\nperitoneal dialysate) without obvious source of infection.\\nBroad spectrum abx were started (vanco, cipro, aztreonam (pcn\\nallergy)) empirically.  There was question of retrocardiac\\nopacity on CXR, though not clear. Rheum consult obtained given\\nhip discomfort, who felt septic joint unlikely.  Neurology\\nconsult obtained who felt autonomic seizure unlikely.\\n.\\nPt initiated peritoneal dialysis.  In this setting she has been\\nhaving some nausea, which has made taking her home labetalol\\ndifficult, resulting in some rising BPs.  She is called out to\\nmedical service for ongoing management and workup of fever,\\nnausea, and hypertension.  Her hip pain has resolved completely\\nwithout further intervention.\\n.\\nFloor course:\\nFever: Spike fever in MICU to 102. Started on Levoquin,\\nAztreonam, and Vanc. Source unclear at this point, but CXR with\\nquestion of retrocardiac opacity. There is a possibility of\\naspiration pneumonitis. Other etiologies include peritoneal\\nfluid (PD cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have\\nany indwelling lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be\\nseptic arthritis but no pain with movement on exam makes this\\nless likely. Peritoneal dialysis cultures negative so far.\\nContinued levo/vanco/aztreonam for 2 days empirically. Then\\nd/ced the Abx as no infectious etiologies were found. Steroids\\nback to home dosage. BCx, UCx (final neg), Peritoneal cultures\\nnegative at discharge.\\n.\\n# Labile blood pressure: h/o of difficult to control BP with\\nepisodes of hypertensive emergency in the past. Normal SBP runs\\nin 170s. Having nausea in setting of new PD, no evidence of\\nintracranial bleeding on clinical exam, though INR had been\\nsupratherapeutic so remains in differential, though not\\nbradycardic. Continue home BP meds :Labetalol 900 mg PO TID but\\ndifficult for patient to tolerate due to nausea, Aliskiren *NF*\\n150 mg Oral [**Hospital1 **], NIFEdipine CR 60 mg PO DAILY, clonidine patch,\\nhydralazine given hypertensive in setting of nausa.\\n.\\n# Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or\\nfracture on MRI though there is a small effusion.

He was transferred to\\n[**Hospital1 69**] for further management.\\n\\n1. Pulmonary embolism:  Upon admission the patient was given\\na bedside echocardiogram which revealed the left ventricular\\ncavity was mildly dilated.  Overall left ventricular systolic\\nfunction was unable to be assessed.  The right ventricular\\ncavity was moderately dilated and the right ventricular\\nsystolic function appeared to be depressed.  A repeat\\nechocardiogram was performed which showed that the left\\natrium was mildly dilated.  There was mild symmetrical left\\nventricular hypertrophy.  The left ventricular cavity size\\nwas normal.  Overall left ventricular systolic function was\\nnormal with an ejection fraction of approximately 70%.  The\\nright ventricular cavity was moderately dilated.  There was\\nglobal right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.  The aortic\\nroot was mildly dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets were\\nmildly thickened but not stenotic.  Mild aortic regurgitation\\nwas seen.  The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.\\nThere was no mitral valve prolapse.  Trivial mitral\\nregurgitation was seen.  The left ventricular pattern\\nsuggests impaired relaxation.  There was no pericardial\\neffusion.  Multiple laboratory studies were drawn to\\ndetermine the patient's coagulation status.  Protein C was\\nslightly elevated with a value of 132.  Protein S was normal\\nwith a value of 91.  Homocystine was slightly elevated with a\\nvalue of 14.6.  Anticardiolipin antibody studies were normal.\\nThe prothrombin mutation analysis showed no mutations and the\\nfactor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5244**] analysis showed no genetic mutations also.\\nThe patient remained on a heparin drip and he was seen by the\\npulmonary team for evaluation of whether thrombolysis therapy\\nshould be initiated.

There is signal loss in the liver\\nbetween the in-phase and out-of-phase sequence, consistent with\\nhepatic steatosis.  Focal arterial hyperenhancement is noted\\nwithin segment VI of the liver (sequence 1501, image 43) - this\\narea has no T2 correlate and does not demonstrate washout on the\\ndelayed phase.  There is also peripheral arterial\\nhyperenhancement within segment VII (sequence 1501, image 77) -\\nagain this area has no T2 correlate and does not demonstrate\\nwashout on the delayed phase.  Both of these areas likely\\nrepresent transient hepatic intensity differences.  The hepatic\\nartery is patent, and there is conventional hepatic arterial\\nanatomy.  The portal and hepatic veins are patent.  There is a\\nstent in situ within the common bile duct.  The common bile and\\ncommon hepatic ducts remain dilated with the common hepatic duct\\nmeasuring 1.5 cm in diameter. There is also central intrahepatic\\nduct dilatation.  The gallbladder is normal.\\n\\nThere is moderate volume ascites within the peritoneal cavity.\\nThere is splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 17.8 cm in\\nlength.

Because of\\nrepeated triggering as well as concern for airway protection,\\npatient was transferred to the ICU. In the ICU, patient was\\ncontinued on lactulose/rifaximin regimen (via NG tube) as well\\nas benzodiazepines for withdrawal. There was also concern for\\ncontinuing infection. Peritoneal tap performed which did not\\nfnid evidence of SBP. Chest CT showed ground glass opacities\\nsuspicious for pneumonia, for which patient was treated with\\nbroad spectrum antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia\\n(vancomycin and cefepime). Head CT was negative for acute\\nprocess. Abdominal ultrasound found no evidence of clot. Patient\\nalso found to have [**Last Name (un) **], which resolved with fluid resuscitation\\nand albumin. Patient thereafter returned to the floor briefly,\\nwhere he continued to be agitated and having hallucinations.\\nFlagyl was added for coverage of anaerobes/aspiration. Because\\nof respiratory distress with desaturations, worsening\\nencephalopathy, patient returned to the ICU again, where\\nantibiotics were continued for a full course for HCAP (1 week)\\nand patient was treated aggressively with lactulose for\\nencephalopathy. Abdominal CT conducted which was unremarkable.\\nPatient was noted to clear over several days. Tube feeds were\\nstarted, and patient was returned to the floor. Electrolytes\\nwere aggressively repleted. Patient remained clear throughout\\nremainder of admission.\\n\\n# ETOH/HCV CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of cirrhosis\\ncomplicated by portal hypertension, varices, variceal bleed.\\nAfter ICU course detailed above, patient continued on lactulose\\nand rifaximin. In addition, lasix and aldactone were initiated.\\nBecause of diffuse liver nodularity appreciated on CT and\\nultrasound when patient first admitted (as well as known lesion\\nin the past), MRI was conducted, which did not show evidence of\\nHCC. Patient did develop a transient leukocytosis on the floor.\\nDiagnostic paracentesis performed which showed no evidence for\\nSBP; other infectious workup was unremarkable.  Leukocytosis\\nresolved without further intervention. Plan was for patient to\\nhave close follow up with hepatology as well as PCP for\\ncontinuing management.  Patient could be reviewed for transplant\\nin ~6 months if able to remain sober.\\n\\n# ERCP/BILIARY STRICTURE: Patient initially presented for ERCP\\nfor stent removal. Strictures potentially [**12-30**] ulcerative colitis\\nwith PSC seen on ERCP.  Patient underwent ERCP for stent removal\\nand sphincterotomy on [**2163-10-4**] after stabilization s/p ICU\\ncourse, without complication. Plan was for outpatient follow up\\nas well as follow up of cytology.\\n\\n# HYPOMAGNESEMIA: Patient found to be hypomag on [**2163-10-11**] on day\\nof discharge. Intravenous mag repletion was attempted but\\npatient lost IV access. Therefore, patient was initiated on\\nmagnesium oxide PO with plan for close follow of electrolytes as\\nan outpatient.\\n\\n# [**Last Name (un) **]: On admission, patient noted to have [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr as high\\nas 2.1.

Patient was\\nadvanced as swallowing function improved. He is cleared for\\nnectar thick liquids, ground solids and may be advanced as\\ntolerated. The day before discharge, the patient accidentally\\npulled the feeding tube while changing clothes. The tube was\\nreplaced and advanced to a post-pyloric location in\\ninterventional radiology without complication. The tube was\\nbridled.\\n\\n# HYPERKALEMIA: Patient's potassium trended up towards the end\\nof admission, felt to be likely [**12-30**] potassium sparing diuretic\\nuse.

In addition, you were found to have a\\nlikely pneumonia, for which you were treated with IV\\nantibiotics. After an acute period of treatment requiring time\\nin the ICU (intensive care unit), your status improved\\ndramatically.\\n\\nAfter leaving the ICU, we maintained you on tube feeds.

He underwent ERCP at\\n[**Hospital1 18**] because there was bleeding noted from a prior CBD stent,\\nwhich was retrieved and replaced.  A ampullary stricture was\\nnoted and plans were made to readdress with sphinchterotomy in a\\nmonth. During this procedure, 5 cords of grade II esophageal\\nvarices were banded.  He was rapidly discharged back to [**Hospital 7912**] due to stability of his hemodynamics and\\nhemoglobin.\\n\\nPrior to the aforementioned episode, patient was admitted\\n[**2075-7-11**] to an OSH with hepatic encephalopathy complicated by\\nalcohol withdrawal and delirium tremens requiring lorazepam gtt.\\n Previous [**Hospital1 18**] notes suggest OSH admissions for encephalopathy\\nalso occured in [**5-/2163**] and 6/[**2162**].\\n\\nToday, patient came for ERCP because of biliary stricture and\\ndilated CBD previously stented 3-4 times.

Timolol eye drops.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Very independent at home.  He was driving\\nwith his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] smoking or alcohol.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  No history of aneurysm or stroke.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile with blood\\npressures 138/70.  Heart rate 76.  Oxygen saturation\\ninitially 99% on face mask, but now is doing well on room\\nair.  General medical exam is unremarkable.  Neurological\\nexam:  The patient is alert and awake.  He answers\\nappropriately to questions.  He follows commands well.  He\\nhas left-sided neglect and a positive grasp reflex in the\\nright hand.  The patient has also left-sided hemiplegia with\\na left-sided facial droop and left arm and leg have 0/5\\nstrength.  The right side is full strength.

He was transferred to\\n[**Hospital1 69**] for further management.\\n\\n1. Pulmonary embolism:  Upon admission the patient was given\\na bedside echocardiogram which revealed the left ventricular\\ncavity was mildly dilated.  Overall left ventricular systolic\\nfunction was unable to be assessed.  The right ventricular\\ncavity was moderately dilated and the right ventricular\\nsystolic function appeared to be depressed.  A repeat\\nechocardiogram was performed which showed that the left\\natrium was mildly dilated.  There was mild symmetrical left\\nventricular hypertrophy.  The left ventricular cavity size\\nwas normal.  Overall left ventricular systolic function was\\nnormal with an ejection fraction of approximately 70%.  The\\nright ventricular cavity was moderately dilated.  There was\\nglobal right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.  The aortic\\nroot was mildly dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets were\\nmildly thickened but not stenotic.  Mild aortic regurgitation\\nwas seen.  The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.\\nThere was no mitral valve prolapse.  Trivial mitral\\nregurgitation was seen.  The left ventricular pattern\\nsuggests impaired relaxation.  There was no pericardial\\neffusion.  Multiple laboratory studies were drawn to\\ndetermine the patient's coagulation status.  Protein C was\\nslightly elevated with a value of 132.  Protein S was normal\\nwith a value of 91.  Homocystine was slightly elevated with a\\nvalue of 14.6.  Anticardiolipin antibody studies were normal.\\nThe prothrombin mutation analysis showed no mutations and the\\nfactor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5244**] analysis showed no genetic mutations also.\\nThe patient remained on a heparin drip and he was seen by the\\npulmonary team for evaluation of whether thrombolysis therapy\\nshould be initiated.  The pulmonary team recommended\\nconservative management with intravenous heparin.  They\\nrecommended no thrombolytics unless the patient were to\\nbecome hemodynamically unstable.  The patient was monitored\\nin the coronary care unit on a telemetry bed.  His O2\\nsaturations remained above 92% on two liters.  He showed no\\nsymptoms of hemodynamic instability and after 48 hours he was\\nstarted on Coumadin.  He was then transferred to the floor\\nuntil his INR became therapeutic.  The patient was then set\\nup with the outpatient [**Hospital 197**] clinic at the VA who will\\nmanage his Coumadin and INR with a goal INR between 2 and 3.\\nHe should remain on Coumadin for a minimum of six months.\\n\\n2.

There is a dense streak of atelectasis seen at\\nthe left base.\\n\\nContinued low lung volumes.\\n\\nEEG [**2163-9-27**]:\\nAbnormal EEG due to markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the\\nslow disorganized background, the lower voltage background over\\nthe left side, and the bursts of generalized slowing. The first\\nand final abnormalities signify a widespread encephalopathy\\naffecting both cortical and subcortical structures. The lower\\nvoltage background on the left side raises the possibility of\\nmaterial interposed between the cortical surface and recording\\nelectrodes, e.g. subdural fluid.

There is signal loss in the liver\\nbetween the in-phase and out-of-phase sequence, consistent with\\nhepatic steatosis.  Focal arterial hyperenhancement is noted\\nwithin segment VI of the liver (sequence 1501, image 43) - this\\narea has no T2 correlate and does not demonstrate washout on the\\ndelayed phase.  There is also peripheral arterial\\nhyperenhancement within segment VII (sequence 1501, image 77) -\\nagain this area has no T2 correlate and does not demonstrate\\nwashout on the delayed phase.  Both of these areas likely\\nrepresent transient hepatic intensity differences.  The hepatic\\nartery is patent, and there is conventional hepatic arterial\\nanatomy.  The portal and hepatic veins are patent.  There is a\\nstent in situ within the common bile duct.  The common bile and\\ncommon hepatic ducts remain dilated with the common hepatic duct\\nmeasuring 1.5 cm in diameter. There is also central intrahepatic\\nduct dilatation.  The gallbladder is normal.\\n\\nThere is moderate volume ascites within the peritoneal cavity.\\nThere is splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 17.8 cm in\\nlength.

Because of\\nrepeated triggering as well as concern for airway protection,\\npatient was transferred to the ICU. In the ICU, patient was\\ncontinued on lactulose/rifaximin regimen (via NG tube) as well\\nas benzodiazepines for withdrawal. There was also concern for\\ncontinuing infection. Peritoneal tap performed which did not\\nfnid evidence of SBP. Chest CT showed ground glass opacities\\nsuspicious for pneumonia, for which patient was treated with\\nbroad spectrum antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia\\n(vancomycin and cefepime). Head CT was negative for acute\\nprocess. Abdominal ultrasound found no evidence of clot. Patient\\nalso found to have [**Last Name (un) **], which resolved with fluid resuscitation\\nand albumin. Patient thereafter returned to the floor briefly,\\nwhere he continued to be agitated and having hallucinations.\\nFlagyl was added for coverage of anaerobes/aspiration. Because\\nof respiratory distress with desaturations, worsening\\nencephalopathy, patient returned to the ICU again, where\\nantibiotics were continued for a full course for HCAP (1 week)\\nand patient was treated aggressively with lactulose for\\nencephalopathy. Abdominal CT conducted which was unremarkable.\\nPatient was noted to clear over several days. Tube feeds were\\nstarted, and patient was returned to the floor. Electrolytes\\nwere aggressively repleted. Patient remained clear throughout\\nremainder of admission.\\n\\n# ETOH/HCV CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of cirrhosis\\ncomplicated by portal hypertension, varices, variceal bleed.\\nAfter ICU course detailed above, patient continued on lactulose\\nand rifaximin. In addition, lasix and aldactone were initiated.\\nBecause of diffuse liver nodularity appreciated on CT and\\nultrasound when patient first admitted (as well as known lesion\\nin the past), MRI was conducted, which did not show evidence of\\nHCC. Patient did develop a transient leukocytosis on the floor.\\nDiagnostic paracentesis performed which showed no evidence for\\nSBP; other infectious workup was unremarkable.  Leukocytosis\\nresolved without further intervention. Plan was for patient to\\nhave close follow up with hepatology as well as PCP for\\ncontinuing management.  Patient could be reviewed for transplant\\nin ~6 months if able to remain sober.\\n\\n# ERCP/BILIARY STRICTURE: Patient initially presented for ERCP\\nfor stent removal. Strictures potentially [**12-30**] ulcerative colitis\\nwith PSC seen on ERCP.  Patient underwent ERCP for stent removal\\nand sphincterotomy on [**2163-10-4**] after stabilization s/p ICU\\ncourse, without complication. Plan was for outpatient follow up\\nas well as follow up of cytology.\\n\\n# HYPOMAGNESEMIA: Patient found to be hypomag on [**2163-10-11**] on day\\nof discharge. Intravenous mag repletion was attempted but\\npatient lost IV access. Therefore, patient was initiated on\\nmagnesium oxide PO with plan for close follow of electrolytes as\\nan outpatient.\\n\\n# [**Last Name (un) **]: On admission, patient noted to have [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr as high\\nas 2.1.

Patient was\\nadvanced as swallowing function improved. He is cleared for\\nnectar thick liquids, ground solids and may be advanced as\\ntolerated. The day before discharge, the patient accidentally\\npulled the feeding tube while changing clothes. The tube was\\nreplaced and advanced to a post-pyloric location in\\ninterventional radiology without complication. The tube was\\nbridled.\\n\\n# HYPERKALEMIA: Patient's potassium trended up towards the end\\nof admission, felt to be likely [**12-30**] potassium sparing diuretic\\nuse. Patient's dose of lasix was uptitrated with good result.\\n\\n# LOWER EXTREMITY PAIN/NEUROPATHY: Stable. B12 (high) and Folate\\n(normal) levels unrevealing.  Continued amitryptiline.

You were admitted to the\\n[**Hospital1 18**] for treatment of altered mental status. It was likely that\\nyour altered mental status was due to both hepatic\\nencephalopathy (especially because you had not been taking\\nlactulose/rifaximin) as well as alcohol withdrawal (because of\\nyour heavy alcohol use). In addition, you were found to have a\\nlikely pneumonia, for which you were treated with IV\\nantibiotics. After an acute period of treatment requiring time\\nin the ICU (intensive care unit), your status improved\\ndramatically.\\n\\nAfter leaving the ICU, we maintained you on tube feeds. Our\\nspeech and swallow experts advised us to take advancement of\\nyour oral intake slowly, because your swallowing muscles was\\nrather weak. You tolerated tube feeds well and we will continue\\nthese after you leave.\\n\\nIn addition, you had initially presented to the hospital for a\\nfollow up ERCP procedure. We performed this procedure, in\\nconjunction with an EGD/endoscopy, and the stent was removed\\nwithout complication.\\n\\nSeveral days after returning to the medical floor, you were\\nfound to have an elevated white blood cell count (often a\\nreflection of an infection). You felt well otherwise and did not\\nhave a fever. We performed an infectious evaluation including a\\nparacentesis (sampling fluid from the belly), which was negative\\nfor an infection.

Selective coronary angiography of this\\nco-dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery\\ndisease.  The LMCA had mild disease.  The LAD had a 60-70%\\nproximal tubular lesion.  The LCX was subtotally occluded with\\ndiffuse in stent restenosis and thrombosis.  The RCA was\\ndistally occluded and filled by collaterals. 2.  Limited resting\\nhemodynamics revealed significantly elevated left sided filling\\npressures with LVEDP of 45 mm Hg.  There was no gradient upon\\npullback of the catheter from LV to the aorta.  There was mild\\nsystemic arterial hypotension of 94/65 mm Hg. 3.  Left\\nventriculography was deferred. 4.  Successful insertion of IABP.\\n\\n[**7-28**] Echo: PREGrafting: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or\\ncolor Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is moderately\\ndilated. There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular\\nsystolic dysfunction with dyskinesis of the inferolateral wall,\\nhypokinesis of the distal anterior and anterolateral walls..\\nLVEF ~25-30%. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall\\nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately\\nthickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic\\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\\nthickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The MR\\nincreased to (2+) moderate during manipulation of the heart\\nduring off pump CABG. A well positioned balloon pump catheter is\\nseen in the descending thoracic aorta. Post Grafting: 1+ mitral\\nregurgitation seen post-grafting. Aortic balloon pump catheter\\nremains in descending thoracic aorta just distal to the\\nsubclavian artery. LV function and wall motion appears mildly\\nimproved. (EF 30-35%.) The distal anterior wall appears to be\\nimproved. Previous wall motion abnormalities persist.

When\\nhis cardiac enzymes trended up (CD 1452->1463 with positive MB\\nfraction), it was decided to take him to the cath lab. In the\\ncath lab, he was found to have a subtotally occluded LCx with\\ndiffuse in-stent restenosis. The RCA was occluded distally but\\nfilled by collaterals. His LAD had 60-70% proximal disease. It\\nwas felt that treating the LCx lesions in the cath lab might\\ncompromise his collateral circulation and he was referred to CT\\nsurgery for evaluation. Hemodynamics revealed LV EDP of 45 and\\nan IABP was placed. On [**7-28**] he was brought to the operating room\\nwhere he underwent a off-pump coronary artery bypass graft x 3.\\nPlease see operative report for surgical details. Following\\nsurgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring\\nin stable condition. Later on op day he was weaned from\\nsedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op\\nday one his IABP was removed. Beta-blockers and diuretics were\\ninitiated on this day and he was gently diuresed towards his\\npre-op weight. On post-op day two he was transferred to the\\ntelemetry floor for further care.Pain services,substance\\nabuse,psychiatry and social work were all consulted for\\nreccommendations.

significant for pulmonary embolism in\\nthe past, as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on\\nCoumadin, meniere's disease, and increasing \"memory loss\" who\\npresents from an outside hospital after having a left arm\\nshaking at home, and then having dysarthria and rapidly\\ndeclining mental status requiring intubation.\\n\\nOn head CT, he had a right frontal parietal intraparenchymal\\nhemorrhage.  He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit\\nwhere he was soon extubated, but then had another episode of\\nmental status change and was found to have pneumonia.  His\\nblood pressure was monitored closely while in the Intensive\\nCare Unit and eventually he was extubated and sent to the\\nfloor in good condition.\\n\\nOn exam, he has a left hemiplegia and left neglect, but is\\nresponsive and following commands.  He was later found to be\\nin acute respiratory distress after being called out to the\\nfloor initially and he subsequently returned to the Intensive\\nCare Unit for reintubation and then was again transferred to\\nthe floor on [**2101-11-28**] after being stabilized.  He\\ncontinued to have a rather high oxygen requirement on initial\\ncall out, however, this was eventually resolved.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\\n2.  Heart block, status post pacemaker.\\n3.  Pulmonary embolism 12 years ago in the setting of total\\nhip replacement, status post IVC filter and \"mild memory\\nloss\" according to the family.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.\\n2.  Famotidine.\\n3.  Zosyn for the pneumonia which he received a 14 day course\\nof and stopped.\\n4.  Brimonidine 0.15% eye drops.\\n5.  Timolol eye drops.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Very independent at home.  He was driving\\nwith his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] smoking or alcohol.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  No history of aneurysm or stroke.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile with blood\\npressures 138/70.  Heart rate 76.  Oxygen saturation\\ninitially 99% on face mask, but now is doing well on room\\nair.  General medical exam is unremarkable.  Neurological\\nexam:  The patient is alert and awake.  He answers\\nappropriately to questions.  He follows commands well.  He\\nhas left-sided neglect and a positive grasp reflex in the\\nright hand.  The patient has also left-sided hemiplegia with\\na left-sided facial droop and left arm and leg have 0/5\\nstrength.  The right side is full strength.  The patient also\\nhas reflexes that are slightly brisker on the right\\nthroughout.  He has a left upgoing toe and withdraws to pain\\nbilaterally in his extremities.\\n\\nLABORATORIES AND STUDIES:  On the day of discharge, his white\\nblood cell count is 9.1, hematocrit 35.3, platelet count\\n511,000, PT 13.6, PTT 28.8, INR 1.2.  Urinalysis is pending.\\nGlucose 104.  BUN 23, creatinine 0.8, sodium 138, potassium\\n3.5, chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, calcium 9.9, phosphate\\n2.9, magnesium 1.8.  Blood cultures:  No growth to date.\\nUrine culture from [**11-28**] showed no growth.  Chest x-ray\\nshowed no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure\\nand no pneumothorax.\\n\\nCT showed as mentioned, a large right frontal parietal\\nintraparenchymal hemorrhage with some leftward shift to the\\nseptum lucidum, no uncle herniation and also small amounts of\\nhemorrhage in the dependent portions of the occipital horns\\nbilaterally.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Neurology\\nService with an acute large right intraparenchymal hemorrhage\\nand severe left-sided hemiplegia with left-sided neglect.  It\\nwas felt that his hemorrhage was likely due to amyloid,\\nalthough, the patient was on Coumadin also at the time.  The\\npatient's Coumadin was stopped. Given his diagnosis of probable\\namyloid angiopathy, he is not an optimal long-term Coumadin\\ncandidate.  The patient did well throughout admission after\\nresolution of his pneumonia.  He was given a course of Zosyn for\\n14 days after which time his oxygenation became much improved and\\nhe was able to remain stable on the floor.  He had no further\\ntemperature spikes. He failed two swallow evaluations and thus\\nwas given a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube per the\\nGastrointestinal Service for his nutritional needs.\\n\\nThe patient was discharged to rehabilitation in good\\ncondition on [**2101-12-7**].  He will receive follow-up in\\nthe [**Hospital 4038**] Clinic.  The date to be scheduled before\\ndischarge. Follow-up with his PCP and Cardiology to be scheduled\\nas well to optimize management of his atrial fibrillation.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.\\n2.

He had dismissed the pain as being due to acid\\nreflux. Of note, he had stopped taking many of his cardiac\\nmedications (including plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and\\nimdur) without discussing the matter with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] finally\\ncame into the hospital at [**Hospital3 **] because his pain did not go\\naway after a few days despite taking antacids. He also admits to\\ndoing 4 lines of cocaine 2 days prior to presentation. During\\nhis initial work-up at [**Hospital1 **], he was found to have ST\\ndepressions in V5 and V6 with troponin of 3.1, at which point he\\nwas transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. He received ASA, plavix 300mg, and\\nlovenox and was on a nitro gtt prior to transfer. He was also on\\nan amiodarone gtt for reported frequent ectopy.\\nIn the ED, his initial VS were: 97.2 146/85 25 95% 4L. He was\\nhaving mild chest pain and frequent runs of NSVT. Cardiology was\\nconsulted for positive biomarkers. He was put on an integrillin\\ngtt and given morphine and zofran for symptom management.

On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded\\nregion within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9\\nmm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may\\nrepresent an unusual focus of red marrow. No sclerosis is seen\\non the corresponding plain films. There is a small right hip\\njoint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint\\nas well, at the upper limits of normal. There is no soft tissue\\nabnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.\\nIMPRESSION: 1. Small right hip joint effusion. 2. No bone marrow\\nedema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis. 3. Nonspecific small\\nfocus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral\\nhead is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red\\nmarrow.\\n\\nTTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is\\nsevere symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\\nventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular\\nwall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is\\nhyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18 mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is\\nidentified. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\\nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally\\nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The\\nincreased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac\\noutput. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no\\nsystolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)\\nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\\nsystolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.\\nThe effusion appears circumferential. There are no\\nechocardiographic signs of tamponade.\\nIMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\\nhyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient.\\nMild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.\\nFindings consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**],\\npulmonary hypertension has developed (also present on the study\\nfrom [**2140-5-20**]). Pericardial effusion is also new.\\n\\nV/Q scan ([**9-21**]): Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol\\nin 8 views demonstrate no focal defects with improved\\nventilation to the posterior right basal segment.  Perfusion\\nimages in the same 8 views show improved perfusion to the\\nposterior right basal segement with a persistent small defect\\nbut no new findings.\\nChest x-ray shows cardiomgealy and left basilar atelectasis.\\nIMPRESSION: Improved V/Q scan from [**9-/2139**] with no findings to\\nsuggest acute pulmonary embolism.\\n\\nB/L upper ext U/S ([**9-21**]): Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of\\nthe\\nright and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,\\nbasilic and cephalic veins were performed.

Patient was on the floor on [**9-20**],\\ngiven morphine for the hip pain.  She then had an episode of\\nhypotension and unresponsiveness and transferred to the MICU for\\ncloser monitoring. The patient got 2L IVFs and narcan and\\nimproved, in fact, found to be hypertensive upon arrival to\\nMICU.\\n.\\nMICU Course: On [**9-20**], the patient triggered for hypotension\\n(82/45), hypothermia (92.9) and altered mental status with\\ndifficult arousability in setting of recent blood transfusion.\\nConcern was for sepsis, autonomic seizure, transfusion reaction,\\npulmonary embolus and/or narcosis.  Mental status cleared\\nsomewhat with narcan. Renal c/s felt episode likely [**2-11**]\\naccumulation of morphine active metabolites. V/Q scan\\ndemonstrated improvement since prior study. Patient's home\\nprednisone dose was increased from 5 to 15mg with thought that\\npatient may be stressed in setting of acute illness. She was\\nfebrile on [**9-21**] and resultingly started in vancomycin,\\naztreonam, and levofloxacin. PD fluid was not c/w SBP. CXR was\\nclear. Urine culture and blood cultures are pending. Patient's\\nBP was in the 110s so hydralazine was stopped. Her other BP meds\\nwere otherwise continued.  Plan was/is to follow renal recs for\\nPD. If, in 24-48 hours (once cultures have had 48-72 hours to\\ngrow) no source has been located, would d/c antibiotics except\\nfor levofloxacin.  Would continue levoflox for total 5 day\\ncourse for pneumonia possibly ? aspiration pneumonitis during\\nepisode of altered mental status.  If patient has leg pain\\nagain, may consider neurogenic source such a piriformis syndrome\\nas suggested by neurology. Would add neurontin 100mg TID with\\nroom to titrate up to 300mg TID. Neuro also recommended PT with\\nTENS unit and referral to pain clinic although patient's pain is\\ncurrently absent.\\n.\\nFYI **** per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] --- Because of ? increase in\\ncardiomegaly on CXR, she got an echo yesterday.  In addition to\\nher known HOCM, this showed (1) a small pericardial effusion,\\nand (2) pulmonary hypertension with an estimated tricuspid\\ngradient of 50 mm Hg. They probably need to be followed up over\\ntime (particularly the pulmonary hypertension).  We did\\nevaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making\\nchronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.\\nIt would be good if we could arrange a PULMONARY CLINIC FOLLOW\\nUP for Ms. [**Known lastname **] after discharge with either [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].****\\n\\n.\\nShe underwent CT head, and V/Q scan which were unremarkable.\\nHer steroid dose was increased to 15mg given concern for need\\nfor stress dose steroids. After transfer from the MICU, her\\nsteroids were dropped back to 5mg, her home dose with the\\napproval of [**Last Name (un) **].\\n.\\nHer hypotensive episode was thought to be due to a delayed\\nclearing of the morphine due to her renal failure.  Her\\nhydralazine was discontinued.  On day 2 of her MICU stay, she\\ndeveloped a fever to 102.  She was pan-cultured (blood, urine,\\nperitoneal dialysate) without obvious source of infection.\\nBroad spectrum abx were started (vanco, cipro, aztreonam (pcn\\nallergy)) empirically.  There was question of retrocardiac\\nopacity on CXR, though not clear. Rheum consult obtained given\\nhip discomfort, who felt septic joint unlikely.  Neurology\\nconsult obtained who felt autonomic seizure unlikely.\\n.\\nPt initiated peritoneal dialysis.  In this setting she has been\\nhaving some nausea, which has made taking her home labetalol\\ndifficult, resulting in some rising BPs.  She is called out to\\nmedical service for ongoing management and workup of fever,\\nnausea, and hypertension.  Her hip pain has resolved completely\\nwithout further intervention.\\n.\\nFloor course:\\nFever: Spike fever in MICU to 102. Started on Levoquin,\\nAztreonam, and Vanc. Source unclear at this point, but CXR with\\nquestion of retrocardiac opacity. There is a possibility of\\naspiration pneumonitis. Other etiologies include peritoneal\\nfluid (PD cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have\\nany indwelling lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be\\nseptic arthritis but no pain with movement on exam makes this\\nless likely. Peritoneal dialysis cultures negative so far.\\nContinued levo/vanco/aztreonam for 2 days empirically. Then\\nd/ced the Abx as no infectious etiologies were found. Steroids\\nback to home dosage. BCx, UCx (final neg), Peritoneal cultures\\nnegative at discharge.\\n.\\n# Labile blood pressure: h/o of difficult to control BP with\\nepisodes of hypertensive emergency in the past. Normal SBP runs\\nin 170s. Having nausea in setting of new PD, no evidence of\\nintracranial bleeding on clinical exam, though INR had been\\nsupratherapeutic so remains in differential, though not\\nbradycardic. Continue home BP meds :Labetalol 900 mg PO TID but\\ndifficult for patient to tolerate due to nausea, Aliskiren *NF*\\n150 mg Oral [**Hospital1 **], NIFEdipine CR 60 mg PO DAILY, clonidine patch,\\nhydralazine given hypertensive in setting of nausa.\\n.\\n# Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or\\nfracture on MRI though there is a small effusion.

The AT refilled below\\nthe fibular head and was open all the way to the dorsalis\\npedis pulses.  The patient tolerated the arteriogram.  PICC\\nlines were attempted to provide intravenous access, but the\\nveins were too small and this was aborted.\\n\\nThe patient had an arterial blood gas done in preparation for\\nrevascularization of his lower leg, pH was 7.51, PO2 61, PCO2\\nwas 36, CO2 30, base excess 5.  The patient underwent on\\n[**2190-6-11**] a left femoral AT bypass graft to the PTFE.  He\\ntolerated the procedure well.  He was transferred to the PACU\\nin stable condition.  Immediate postoperative check he was\\nhemodynamically stable.  Postoperatively, hematocrit was\\n32.4, PTT 84.8, BUN 6, creatinine 0.6.  His extremity was\\nwarm with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse and absent patient.\\nHe continued to do well and was transferred to the VICU.\\nPostoperative day one there were no overnight events.  He\\ncontinued on Vancomycin, Levo and Flagyl.  His diet was\\nadvanced as tolerated.  He required Lasix to diurese.  He was\\nD-lined and transferred to the regular nursing floor.  On [**6-14**]\\nthe patient underwent debridement of the left ankle\\nulceration he tolerated the procedure well and was\\ntransferred to the regular nursing floor.  Coumadin was begun\\non 3 mg per day, ambulation was instituted.  A request for\\nPICC line was requested, but this could not be done.  He was\\ncontinued on his antibiotics and the Foley was discontinued\\nand rehab screening was begun.\\n\\nPhysical therapy saw the patient and recommended short term\\nrehabilitation to improve his mobility and gait.  A reattempt\\nwill be made to place the PICC line at the bedside.  If this\\nis unable to be done, then it will be done in interventional\\nradiology.  He will continue on his antibiotics for a total\\nof two more weeks post discharge.\\n\\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  He is to follow up with Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks time.

The patient was seen and evaluated in the MICU by the CCU\\nteam prior to transfer. The patient was transferred in a guarded\\ncondition.\\n.\\nHospital Course By System:\\n   1. Vascular: Patient was initially admitted to the vascular\\nservice. He was evaluated and it was determined that surgical\\nintervention in his case is not warranted at this time. His\\nmanagement has consisted of [**Month/Day/Year **] pressure control, and\\nmonitoring for signs of vascular compromise. Initial management\\nof hypertension required multiple PO medications in combination\\nwith IV antihypertensives. Initially due to the rising creatine\\nin the setting of vascular compromise to one or both kidneys,\\nACEi and ARBs were held due to concern about further\\nhypoperfusion to the kidney. Renal medicine was consulted on\\n[**9-27**] and approved the use of an ACEi. The patient responded\\nwell to this and was able to remove all IV antihypertensive\\nmedications. His pressure has remained stable with occasional\\nelevations in systolic [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures related to agitation in\\nperiods of light sedation. Quality of pulses were followed and\\nsaw improvement in right lower extremety pulses over his\\nhospitalization. Lactate levels were drawn along with serial\\nabdominal exams to evaluate for signs of bowel ischemia. He was\\nguaiac negative and had no other signs of acute bowel ischemia.\\nExtremeties remained warm with good capillary refill. Creatine\\nstabilized with a maximum value of 2.1 on hospital day 12.  On\\ndischarge the creatinine had trended down to 1.2.  No signs of\\nacute ischemic injury to the carotid arteries. During physical\\ntherapy and daily ambulation, he denies any claudication or\\nnumbness to either legs. Renal perfusion scan performed on [**10-5**]\\nshowed 29% function in the right kidney and 71% of renal\\nfunction performed by the left kidney. Pt was slowly weaned off\\nbp medications as his agitation and kidney function improved.\\nHe was discharged on Propanolol 160mg [**Hospital1 **], Amlodipine 10mg\\ndaily, and Lisinopril 10mg po bid for [**Hospital1 **] pressure management.\\nHe will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Cardiology and Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient will make a follow up appointment with a\\nPCP in the [**Location (un) 5503**] area.  On discharge pt's bllod pressure\\nwas [**Last Name (un) 74635**] well controlled at 110s/70s.\\n.\\n   2. Respiratory: Patient was initially intubated on [**9-16**] for\\nincreasing agitation and poor [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure control secondary\\nto the agitation. During the first days of the admission, he\\nbecame increasingly agitated and at time of intubation, required\\n4 security guards to restrain him for his own safety. He was\\ninitially started on AC but switched to SIMV+PS as tolerated. On\\n[**9-18**] chest x-ray showed signs of a right middle lobe\\ninfiltrate. He was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxican, and\\nZosyn for broad coverage. Culture results indicated the presence\\nof streptococcus pneumoniae (oxacillin sensitive) and Moraxella\\nCatastalsis. Antibiotic regimen was changed to Zosyn only and\\ndosed appropriately for renal function. Patient completed the 10\\nday course on [**9-30**]. Ventilator settings were decreased as\\ntolerated in anticipation of weaning the ventilator and the\\npatient was successfully extubated on [**9-30**]. Repeat CXRs showed\\ngradual improvement in lung function and resolving infiltrates.\\nPatient had spiked another fever on [**9-30**] with worsening CXR and\\nnoted infiltrates. He was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime\\nfor 7 day course. At time of discharge there were no respiratory\\nissues and pt had remained afebrile without a oxygen requirement\\nduring ambulation as well as at rest.\\n.\\n  3. DVT: On [**9-20**] the patient's right arm was disproportantly\\nlarger and firm compared to the left arm. The patient underwent\\na duplex ultrasound which showed non obstructing DVT in the\\naxillary vein not extending to the subclavian. PICC line in the\\nright AC was removed. The patient was not a candidate for\\nanticoagulation due to his other issues and was followed\\nclinically with no further complications with a resolution of\\nthe swelling in his arm prior to d/c.\\n.\\n  4. Pain Control / Sedation: Patient was initially started on\\npropofol in the MICU and switched to Dexmedetomidine with\\nDilaudid bolus PRN. On transfer to the CCU he was switched to\\nVersed and Fentanyl. During his admission, he required\\nincreasing doses of sedative with frequent boluses. On Hospital\\nday 13 he was started on Methadone as an alternative to\\nFentanyl. He also was switched to PRN boluses of Ativan instead\\nwith good control. For further sedation, he was started on\\nstanding does of Haldol with good result. After extubation,\\nsedation and pain control was titrated down to patient comfort\\nand the patient's mental status improved. Neurology was\\nconsulted for evaluation of mental status. As the patient's\\ncognition improved with time and removal of sedating medication,\\nthe recommendation was an EEG which showed diffuse slowing\\nconsistent with a toxic/metabolic picture. Patient's mental\\nstatus improved with the removal of all sedating medications. At\\ntime of discharge he was able to make appropriate cognitive\\ndecisions and was believed to be able to manage his care at\\nhome. Patient was cleared to go home by Occupational Therapy and\\nwas discharged home in a stable condition.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nNone\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

There is signal loss in the liver\\nbetween the in-phase and out-of-phase sequence, consistent with\\nhepatic steatosis.  Focal arterial hyperenhancement is noted\\nwithin segment VI of the liver (sequence 1501, image 43) - this\\narea has no T2 correlate and does not demonstrate washout on the\\ndelayed phase.  There is also peripheral arterial\\nhyperenhancement within segment VII (sequence 1501, image 77) -\\nagain this area has no T2 correlate and does not demonstrate\\nwashout on the delayed phase.  Both of these areas likely\\nrepresent transient hepatic intensity differences.  The hepatic\\nartery is patent, and there is conventional hepatic arterial\\nanatomy.  The portal and hepatic veins are patent.  There is a\\nstent in situ within the common bile duct.  The common bile and\\ncommon hepatic ducts remain dilated with the common hepatic duct\\nmeasuring 1.5 cm in diameter. There is also central intrahepatic\\nduct dilatation.  The gallbladder is normal.\\n\\nThere is moderate volume ascites within the peritoneal cavity.\\nThere is splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 17.8 cm in\\nlength.

Because of\\nrepeated triggering as well as concern for airway protection,\\npatient was transferred to the ICU. In the ICU, patient was\\ncontinued on lactulose/rifaximin regimen (via NG tube) as well\\nas benzodiazepines for withdrawal. There was also concern for\\ncontinuing infection. Peritoneal tap performed which did not\\nfnid evidence of SBP. Chest CT showed ground glass opacities\\nsuspicious for pneumonia, for which patient was treated with\\nbroad spectrum antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia\\n(vancomycin and cefepime). Head CT was negative for acute\\nprocess. Abdominal ultrasound found no evidence of clot. Patient\\nalso found to have [**Last Name (un) **], which resolved with fluid resuscitation\\nand albumin. Patient thereafter returned to the floor briefly,\\nwhere he continued to be agitated and having hallucinations.\\nFlagyl was added for coverage of anaerobes/aspiration. Because\\nof respiratory distress with desaturations, worsening\\nencephalopathy, patient returned to the ICU again, where\\nantibiotics were continued for a full course for HCAP (1 week)\\nand patient was treated aggressively with lactulose for\\nencephalopathy. Abdominal CT conducted which was unremarkable.\\nPatient was noted to clear over several days. Tube feeds were\\nstarted, and patient was returned to the floor. Electrolytes\\nwere aggressively repleted. Patient remained clear throughout\\nremainder of admission.\\n\\n# ETOH/HCV CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of cirrhosis\\ncomplicated by portal hypertension, varices, variceal bleed.\\nAfter ICU course detailed above, patient continued on lactulose\\nand rifaximin. In addition, lasix and aldactone were initiated.\\nBecause of diffuse liver nodularity appreciated on CT and\\nultrasound when patient first admitted (as well as known lesion\\nin the past), MRI was conducted, which did not show evidence of\\nHCC. Patient did develop a transient leukocytosis on the floor.\\nDiagnostic paracentesis performed which showed no evidence for\\nSBP; other infectious workup was unremarkable.  Leukocytosis\\nresolved without further intervention. Plan was for patient to\\nhave close follow up with hepatology as well as PCP for\\ncontinuing management.  Patient could be reviewed for transplant\\nin ~6 months if able to remain sober.\\n\\n# ERCP/BILIARY STRICTURE: Patient initially presented for ERCP\\nfor stent removal. Strictures potentially [**12-30**] ulcerative colitis\\nwith PSC seen on ERCP.  Patient underwent ERCP for stent removal\\nand sphincterotomy on [**2163-10-4**] after stabilization s/p ICU\\ncourse, without complication. Plan was for outpatient follow up\\nas well as follow up of cytology.\\n\\n# HYPOMAGNESEMIA: Patient found to be hypomag on [**2163-10-11**] on day\\nof discharge. Intravenous mag repletion was attempted but\\npatient lost IV access. Therefore, patient was initiated on\\nmagnesium oxide PO with plan for close follow of electrolytes as\\nan outpatient.\\n\\n# [**Last Name (un) **]: On admission, patient noted to have [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr as high\\nas 2.1. Resolved with fluid resuscitation and albumin as\\ndescribed above.\\n\\n# HCAP: Patient treated with course of vancomycin/cefepime for\\nHCAP as described above. Resolved.\\n\\n# NUTRITION: Patient was maintained on tube feeds as described\\nin the ICU course. Speech and swallow followed closely along\\nwith a workup including video swallow studies. Patient was\\nadvanced as swallowing function improved. He is cleared for\\nnectar thick liquids, ground solids and may be advanced as\\ntolerated. The day before discharge, the patient accidentally\\npulled the feeding tube while changing clothes. The tube was\\nreplaced and advanced to a post-pyloric location in\\ninterventional radiology without complication. The tube was\\nbridled.\\n\\n# HYPERKALEMIA: Patient's potassium trended up towards the end\\nof admission, felt to be likely [**12-30**] potassium sparing diuretic\\nuse.

In addition, you were found to have a\\nlikely pneumonia, for which you were treated with IV\\nantibiotics. After an acute period of treatment requiring time\\nin the ICU (intensive care unit), your status improved\\ndramatically.\\n\\nAfter leaving the ICU, we maintained you on tube feeds.

He had dismissed the pain as being due to acid\\nreflux. Of note, he had stopped taking many of his cardiac\\nmedications (including plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and\\nimdur) without discussing the matter with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] finally\\ncame into the hospital at [**Hospital3 **] because his pain did not go\\naway after a few days despite taking antacids.

Selective coronary angiography of this\\nco-dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery\\ndisease.  The LMCA had mild disease.  The LAD had a 60-70%\\nproximal tubular lesion.  The LCX was subtotally occluded with\\ndiffuse in stent restenosis and thrombosis.  The RCA was\\ndistally occluded and filled by collaterals. 2.  Limited resting\\nhemodynamics revealed significantly elevated left sided filling\\npressures with LVEDP of 45 mm Hg.  There was no gradient upon\\npullback of the catheter from LV to the aorta.  There was mild\\nsystemic arterial hypotension of 94/65 mm Hg. 3.  Left\\nventriculography was deferred. 4.  Successful insertion of IABP.\\n\\n[**7-28**] Echo: PREGrafting: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or\\ncolor Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is moderately\\ndilated.

When\\nhis cardiac enzymes trended up (CD 1452-&gt;1463 with positive MB\\nfraction), it was decided to take him to the cath lab. In the\\ncath lab, he was found to have a subtotally occluded LCx with\\ndiffuse in-stent restenosis. The RCA was occluded distally but\\nfilled by collaterals. His LAD had 60-70% proximal disease. It\\nwas felt that treating the LCx lesions in the cath lab might\\ncompromise his collateral circulation and he was referred to CT\\nsurgery for evaluation. Hemodynamics revealed LV EDP of 45 and\\nan IABP was placed. On [**7-28**] he was brought to the operating room\\nwhere he underwent a off-pump coronary artery bypass graft x 3.\\nPlease see operative report for surgical details. Following\\nsurgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring\\nin stable condition. Later on op day he was weaned from\\nsedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.

He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit\\nwhere he was soon extubated, but then had another episode of\\nmental status change and was found to have pneumonia.  His\\nblood pressure was monitored closely while in the Intensive\\nCare Unit and eventually he was extubated and sent to the\\nfloor in good condition.\\n\\nOn exam, he has a left hemiplegia and left neglect, but is\\nresponsive and following commands.  He was later found to be\\nin acute respiratory distress after being called out to the\\nfloor initially and he subsequently returned to the Intensive\\nCare Unit for reintubation and then was again transferred to\\nthe floor on [**2101-11-28**] after being stabilized.  He\\ncontinued to have a rather high oxygen requirement on initial\\ncall out, however, this was eventually resolved.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\\n2.

Pulmonary embolism 12 years ago in the setting of total\\nhip replacement, status post IVC filter and \"mild memory\\nloss\" according to the family.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.\\n2.  Famotidine.\\n3.  Zosyn for the pneumonia which he received a 14 day course\\nof and stopped.\\n4.  Brimonidine 0.15% eye drops.\\n5.  Timolol eye drops.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Very independent at home.  He was driving\\nwith his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] smoking or alcohol.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  No history of aneurysm or stroke.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile with blood\\npressures 138/70.  Heart rate 76.  Oxygen saturation\\ninitially 99% on face mask, but now is doing well on room\\nair.  General medical exam is unremarkable.  Neurological\\nexam:  The patient is alert and awake.  He answers\\nappropriately to questions.  He follows commands well.  He\\nhas left-sided neglect and a positive grasp reflex in the\\nright hand.  The patient has also left-sided hemiplegia with\\na left-sided facial droop and left arm and leg have 0/5\\nstrength.  The right side is full strength.

On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded\\nregion within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9\\nmm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may\\nrepresent an unusual focus of red marrow. No sclerosis is seen\\non the corresponding plain films. There is a small right hip\\njoint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint\\nas well, at the upper limits of normal. There is no soft tissue\\nabnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.\\nIMPRESSION: 1. Small right hip joint effusion. 2. No bone marrow\\nedema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis. 3. Nonspecific small\\nfocus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral\\nhead is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red\\nmarrow.\\n\\nTTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is\\nsevere symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\\nventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular\\nwall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is\\nhyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18 mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is\\nidentified. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\\nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally\\nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The\\nincreased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac\\noutput. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no\\nsystolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)\\nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\\nsystolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.\\nThe effusion appears circumferential. There are no\\nechocardiographic signs of tamponade.\\nIMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\\nhyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient.\\nMild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.\\nFindings consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**],\\npulmonary hypertension has developed (also present on the study\\nfrom [**2140-5-20**]). Pericardial effusion is also new.\\n\\nV/Q scan ([**9-21**]): Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol\\nin 8 views demonstrate no focal defects with improved\\nventilation to the posterior right basal segment.

Patient was on the floor on [**9-20**],\\ngiven morphine for the hip pain.  She then had an episode of\\nhypotension and unresponsiveness and transferred to the MICU for\\ncloser monitoring. The patient got 2L IVFs and narcan and\\nimproved, in fact, found to be hypertensive upon arrival to\\nMICU.\\n.\\nMICU Course: On [**9-20**], the patient triggered for hypotension\\n(82/45), hypothermia (92.9) and altered mental status with\\ndifficult arousability in setting of recent blood transfusion.\\nConcern was for sepsis, autonomic seizure, transfusion reaction,\\npulmonary embolus and/or narcosis.  Mental status cleared\\nsomewhat with narcan. Renal c/s felt episode likely [**2-11**]\\naccumulation of morphine active metabolites. V/Q scan\\ndemonstrated improvement since prior study. Patient's home\\nprednisone dose was increased from 5 to 15mg with thought that\\npatient may be stressed in setting of acute illness. She was\\nfebrile on [**9-21**] and resultingly started in vancomycin,\\naztreonam, and levofloxacin. PD fluid was not c/w SBP. CXR was\\nclear. Urine culture and blood cultures are pending. Patient's\\nBP was in the 110s so hydralazine was stopped. Her other BP meds\\nwere otherwise continued.  Plan was/is to follow renal recs for\\nPD. If, in 24-48 hours (once cultures have had 48-72 hours to\\ngrow) no source has been located, would d/c antibiotics except\\nfor levofloxacin.  Would continue levoflox for total 5 day\\ncourse for pneumonia possibly ? aspiration pneumonitis during\\nepisode of altered mental status.  If patient has leg pain\\nagain, may consider neurogenic source such a piriformis syndrome\\nas suggested by neurology. Would add neurontin 100mg TID with\\nroom to titrate up to 300mg TID. Neuro also recommended PT with\\nTENS unit and referral to pain clinic although patient's pain is\\ncurrently absent.\\n.\\nFYI **** per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] --- Because of ? increase in\\ncardiomegaly on CXR, she got an echo yesterday.  In addition to\\nher known HOCM, this showed (1) a small pericardial effusion,\\nand (2) pulmonary hypertension with an estimated tricuspid\\ngradient of 50 mm Hg. They probably need to be followed up over\\ntime (particularly the pulmonary hypertension).  We did\\nevaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making\\nchronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.\\nIt would be good if we could arrange a PULMONARY CLINIC FOLLOW\\nUP for Ms. [**Known lastname **] after discharge with either [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].****\\n\\n.\\nShe underwent CT head, and V/Q scan which were unremarkable.\\nHer steroid dose was increased to 15mg given concern for need\\nfor stress dose steroids. After transfer from the MICU, her\\nsteroids were dropped back to 5mg, her home dose with the\\napproval of [**Last Name (un) **].\\n.\\nHer hypotensive episode was thought to be due to a delayed\\nclearing of the morphine due to her renal failure.  Her\\nhydralazine was discontinued.  On day 2 of her MICU stay, she\\ndeveloped a fever to 102.  She was pan-cultured (blood, urine,\\nperitoneal dialysate) without obvious source of infection.\\nBroad spectrum abx were started (vanco, cipro, aztreonam (pcn\\nallergy)) empirically.  There was question of retrocardiac\\nopacity on CXR, though not clear. Rheum consult obtained given\\nhip discomfort, who felt septic joint unlikely.  Neurology\\nconsult obtained who felt autonomic seizure unlikely.\\n.\\nPt initiated peritoneal dialysis.  In this setting she has been\\nhaving some nausea, which has made taking her home labetalol\\ndifficult, resulting in some rising BPs.  She is called out to\\nmedical service for ongoing management and workup of fever,\\nnausea, and hypertension.  Her hip pain has resolved completely\\nwithout further intervention.\\n.\\nFloor course:\\nFever: Spike fever in MICU to 102. Started on Levoquin,\\nAztreonam, and Vanc. Source unclear at this point, but CXR with\\nquestion of retrocardiac opacity. There is a possibility of\\naspiration pneumonitis. Other etiologies include peritoneal\\nfluid (PD cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have\\nany indwelling lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be\\nseptic arthritis but no pain with movement on exam makes this\\nless likely. Peritoneal dialysis cultures negative so far.\\nContinued levo/vanco/aztreonam for 2 days empirically. Then\\nd/ced the Abx as no infectious etiologies were found. Steroids\\nback to home dosage. BCx, UCx (final neg), Peritoneal cultures\\nnegative at discharge.\\n.\\n# Labile blood pressure: h/o of difficult to control BP with\\nepisodes of hypertensive emergency in the past. Normal SBP runs\\nin 170s. Having nausea in setting of new PD, no evidence of\\nintracranial bleeding on clinical exam, though INR had been\\nsupratherapeutic so remains in differential, though not\\nbradycardic. Continue home BP meds :Labetalol 900 mg PO TID but\\ndifficult for patient to tolerate due to nausea, Aliskiren *NF*\\n150 mg Oral [**Hospital1 **], NIFEdipine CR 60 mg PO DAILY, clonidine patch,\\nhydralazine given hypertensive in setting of nausa.\\n.\\n# Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or\\nfracture on MRI though there is a small effusion. Pain resolved\\nwithout intervention. Continued to monitor\\nand would avoid narcotics, restart slowly if pain resumes.\\nPhysical therapy to follow as an outpatient.

Extremity examination shows right\\nextremity is warm and left extremity proximal to the medial\\nmalleolus with 3 by 4 ulceration with surrounding erythema\\nand cellulitis.  Pulse examination shows palpable femorals\\nbilaterally with palpable popliteals bilaterally.  The right\\ndorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse were\\ndopplerable and the left dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior\\ntibial pulse were dopplerable.\\n\\nLABORATORY:  CBC with a white blood cell count of 20.1,\\nhematocrit 29.7, platelets 62K, BUN 12, creatinine 0.6, K\\n3.6.  [**Name (NI) 2591**] PT/INR 16.5 and 1.9, PTT 35.  Chest x-ray was no\\nactive cardiopulmonary disease.  Electrocardiogram showed no\\nevidence of ischemia and normal sinus rhythm with a rate of\\n81.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Vascular\\nService.  He was continued on his preadmission medications\\nincluding Unasyn 1.5 grams q 6 hours.  Surgical dressings\\nwere normal saline and wet to dry dressings b.i.d. to the\\neffected ulcer site.  The patient underwent venous duplexes\\non [**2190-6-8**] to asses for vein conduit for bypass grafting.  The\\npatient underwent on [**2190-6-6**] an arteriogram, which\\ndemonstrated a gradient across the aortic to the common iliac\\non the left with a 12 mm gradient.  Along the common iliac\\nthere was more gradient of 180 mg across the stent.  It was\\n156 mm with stenosis at the distal start and an occluded left\\nsuperficial femoral artery popliteal.  The AT refilled below\\nthe fibular head and was open all the way to the dorsalis\\npedis pulses.  The patient tolerated the arteriogram.  PICC\\nlines were attempted to provide intravenous access, but the\\nveins were too small and this was aborted.\\n\\nThe patient had an arterial blood gas done in preparation for\\nrevascularization of his lower leg, pH was 7.51, PO2 61, PCO2\\nwas 36, CO2 30, base excess 5.  The patient underwent on\\n[**2190-6-11**] a left femoral AT bypass graft to the PTFE.  He\\ntolerated the procedure well.  He was transferred to the PACU\\nin stable condition.  Immediate postoperative check he was\\nhemodynamically stable.  Postoperatively, hematocrit was\\n32.4, PTT 84.8, BUN 6, creatinine 0.6.  His extremity was\\nwarm with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse and absent patient.\\nHe continued to do well and was transferred to the VICU.\\nPostoperative day one there were no overnight events.  He\\ncontinued on Vancomycin, Levo and Flagyl.  His diet was\\nadvanced as tolerated.  He required Lasix to diurese.  He was\\nD-lined and transferred to the regular nursing floor.  On [**6-14**]\\nthe patient underwent debridement of the left ankle\\nulceration he tolerated the procedure well and was\\ntransferred to the regular nursing floor.  Coumadin was begun\\non 3 mg per day, ambulation was instituted.  A request for\\nPICC line was requested, but this could not be done.  He was\\ncontinued on his antibiotics and the Foley was discontinued\\nand rehab screening was begun.\\n\\nPhysical therapy saw the patient and recommended short term\\nrehabilitation to improve his mobility and gait.  A reattempt\\nwill be made to place the PICC line at the bedside.  If this\\nis unable to be done, then it will be done in interventional\\nradiology.  He will continue on his antibiotics for a total\\nof two more weeks post discharge.\\n\\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  He is to follow up with Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks time.  Goal INR is 2.0 to 2.5.  INR\\nshould be monitored until the patient has reached the steady\\ntherapeutic state.  Coumadin should be adjusted to maintain\\nINR goal.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Folic acid 1 mg q.d., calcium\\ncarbonate 500 mg q.d., multivitamin tablet one q.d.,\\nSimvastatin 10 mg q.d., magnesium oxide 400 mg q.d.,\\nAlbuterol puff one to two q 6 hours prn, Ipratropium bromide\\npuffs 2 inhalers q.i.d., Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. hold for\\nsystolic blood pressure less then 100 and heart rate less\\nthen 60.

The patient was seen and evaluated in the MICU by the CCU\\nteam prior to transfer. The patient was transferred in a guarded\\ncondition.\\n.\\nHospital Course By System:\\n   1. Vascular: Patient was initially admitted to the vascular\\nservice. He was evaluated and it was determined that surgical\\nintervention in his case is not warranted at this time. His\\nmanagement has consisted of [**Month/Day/Year **] pressure control, and\\nmonitoring for signs of vascular compromise. Initial management\\nof hypertension required multiple PO medications in combination\\nwith IV antihypertensives. Initially due to the rising creatine\\nin the setting of vascular compromise to one or both kidneys,\\nACEi and ARBs were held due to concern about further\\nhypoperfusion to the kidney. Renal medicine was consulted on\\n[**9-27**] and approved the use of an ACEi. The patient responded\\nwell to this and was able to remove all IV antihypertensive\\nmedications. His pressure has remained stable with occasional\\nelevations in systolic [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures related to agitation in\\nperiods of light sedation. Quality of pulses were followed and\\nsaw improvement in right lower extremety pulses over his\\nhospitalization. Lactate levels were drawn along with serial\\nabdominal exams to evaluate for signs of bowel ischemia. He was\\nguaiac negative and had no other signs of acute bowel ischemia.\\nExtremeties remained warm with good capillary refill. Creatine\\nstabilized with a maximum value of 2.1 on hospital day 12.  On\\ndischarge the creatinine had trended down to 1.2.  No signs of\\nacute ischemic injury to the carotid arteries. During physical\\ntherapy and daily ambulation, he denies any claudication or\\nnumbness to either legs. Renal perfusion scan performed on [**10-5**]\\nshowed 29% function in the right kidney and 71% of renal\\nfunction performed by the left kidney. Pt was slowly weaned off\\nbp medications as his agitation and kidney function improved.\\nHe was discharged on Propanolol 160mg [**Hospital1 **], Amlodipine 10mg\\ndaily, and Lisinopril 10mg po bid for [**Hospital1 **] pressure management.\\nHe will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Cardiology and Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient will make a follow up appointment with a\\nPCP in the [**Location (un) 5503**] area.  On discharge pt's bllod pressure\\nwas [**Last Name (un) 74635**] well controlled at 110s/70s.\\n.\\n   2. Respiratory: Patient was initially intubated on [**9-16**] for\\nincreasing agitation and poor [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure control secondary\\nto the agitation. During the first days of the admission, he\\nbecame increasingly agitated and at time of intubation, required\\n4 security guards to restrain him for his own safety. He was\\ninitially started on AC but switched to SIMV+PS as tolerated. On\\n[**9-18**] chest x-ray showed signs of a right middle lobe\\ninfiltrate. He was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxican, and\\nZosyn for broad coverage. Culture results indicated the presence\\nof streptococcus pneumoniae (oxacillin sensitive) and Moraxella\\nCatastalsis. Antibiotic regimen was changed to Zosyn only and\\ndosed appropriately for renal function. Patient completed the 10\\nday course on [**9-30**]. Ventilator settings were decreased as\\ntolerated in anticipation of weaning the ventilator and the\\npatient was successfully extubated on [**9-30**]. Repeat CXRs showed\\ngradual improvement in lung function and resolving infiltrates.\\nPatient had spiked another fever on [**9-30**] with worsening CXR and\\nnoted infiltrates. He was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime\\nfor 7 day course. At time of discharge there were no respiratory\\nissues and pt had remained afebrile without a oxygen requirement\\nduring ambulation as well as at rest.\\n.\\n  3. DVT: On [**9-20**] the patient's right arm was disproportantly\\nlarger and firm compared to the left arm. The patient underwent\\na duplex ultrasound which showed non obstructing DVT in the\\naxillary vein not extending to the subclavian. PICC line in the\\nright AC was removed. The patient was not a candidate for\\nanticoagulation due to his other issues and was followed\\nclinically with no further complications with a resolution of\\nthe swelling in his arm prior to d/c.\\n.\\n  4. Pain Control / Sedation: Patient was initially started on\\npropofol in the MICU and switched to Dexmedetomidine with\\nDilaudid bolus PRN. On transfer to the CCU he was switched to\\nVersed and Fentanyl. During his admission, he required\\nincreasing doses of sedative with frequent boluses. On Hospital\\nday 13 he was started on Methadone as an alternative to\\nFentanyl. He also was switched to PRN boluses of Ativan instead\\nwith good control. For further sedation, he was started on\\nstanding does of Haldol with good result. After extubation,\\nsedation and pain control was titrated down to patient comfort\\nand the patient's mental status improved. Neurology was\\nconsulted for evaluation of mental status. As the patient's\\ncognition improved with time and removal of sedating medication,\\nthe recommendation was an EEG which showed diffuse slowing\\nconsistent with a toxic/metabolic picture. Patient's mental\\nstatus improved with the removal of all sedating medications. At\\ntime of discharge he was able to make appropriate cognitive\\ndecisions and was believed to be able to manage his care at\\nhome. Patient was cleared to go home by Occupational Therapy and\\nwas discharged home in a stable condition.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nNone\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

You will need to followup with them in clinic.\\n\\nYou were also seen by the Renal service for your worsening\\nkidney function due to your aortic dissection.  Prior to\\ndischarge, your kidney function had markedly improved.\\n\\nYou were also seen by our physical therapists who felt that you\\nwould benefit from 24 hour supervision initially and\\nrehabilitation.  You did not want to go to an inpatient\\nrehabilitation facility, therefore you will need to have 24 hour\\nsupervision at home.\\n\\nYou were also seen by our psychiatry team and neurology team for\\nyour extreme agitation.  This was likely due to alcohol\\nwithdrawal.  You were treated with medications for this, and\\nafter extubation, your mental status slowly improved.\\n\\nPlease take all your medications as prescribed.  Please go to\\nall appointments as scheduled.

He was transferred to\\n[**Hospital1 69**] for further management.\\n\\n1. Pulmonary embolism:  Upon admission the patient was given\\na bedside echocardiogram which revealed the left ventricular\\ncavity was mildly dilated.  Overall left ventricular systolic\\nfunction was unable to be assessed.  The right ventricular\\ncavity was moderately dilated and the right ventricular\\nsystolic function appeared to be depressed.  A repeat\\nechocardiogram was performed which showed that the left\\natrium was mildly dilated.  There was mild symmetrical left\\nventricular hypertrophy.  The left ventricular cavity size\\nwas normal.  Overall left ventricular systolic function was\\nnormal with an ejection fraction of approximately 70%.  The\\nright ventricular cavity was moderately dilated.  There was\\nglobal right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.  The aortic\\nroot was mildly dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets were\\nmildly thickened but not stenotic.  Mild aortic regurgitation\\nwas seen.  The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.\\nThere was no mitral valve prolapse.  Trivial mitral\\nregurgitation was seen.  The left ventricular pattern\\nsuggests impaired relaxation.  There was no pericardial\\neffusion.  Multiple laboratory studies were drawn to\\ndetermine the patient's coagulation status.  Protein C was\\nslightly elevated with a value of 132.  Protein S was normal\\nwith a value of 91.  Homocystine was slightly elevated with a\\nvalue of 14.6.  Anticardiolipin antibody studies were normal.\\nThe prothrombin mutation analysis showed no mutations and the\\nfactor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5244**] analysis showed no genetic mutations also.\\nThe patient remained on a heparin drip and he was seen by the\\npulmonary team for evaluation of whether thrombolysis therapy\\nshould be initiated.  The pulmonary team recommended\\nconservative management with intravenous heparin.  They\\nrecommended no thrombolytics unless the patient were to\\nbecome hemodynamically unstable.  The patient was monitored\\nin the coronary care unit on a telemetry bed.  His O2\\nsaturations remained above 92% on two liters.  He showed no\\nsymptoms of hemodynamic instability and after 48 hours he was\\nstarted on Coumadin.  He was then transferred to the floor\\nuntil his INR became therapeutic.  The patient was then set\\nup with the outpatient [**Hospital 197**] clinic at the VA who will\\nmanage his Coumadin and INR with a goal INR between 2 and 3.\\nHe should remain on Coumadin for a minimum of six months.\\n\\n2. Bipolar disorder:  The patient was mildly depressed during\\nhis stay in the hospital.  He remained on his home\\npsychiatric medication regimen.

There is signal loss in the liver\\nbetween the in-phase and out-of-phase sequence, consistent with\\nhepatic steatosis.  Focal arterial hyperenhancement is noted\\nwithin segment VI of the liver (sequence 1501, image 43) - this\\narea has no T2 correlate and does not demonstrate washout on the\\ndelayed phase.  There is also peripheral arterial\\nhyperenhancement within segment VII (sequence 1501, image 77) -\\nagain this area has no T2 correlate and does not demonstrate\\nwashout on the delayed phase.  Both of these areas likely\\nrepresent transient hepatic intensity differences.  The hepatic\\nartery is patent, and there is conventional hepatic arterial\\nanatomy.  The portal and hepatic veins are patent.  There is a\\nstent in situ within the common bile duct.  The common bile and\\ncommon hepatic ducts remain dilated with the common hepatic duct\\nmeasuring 1.5 cm in diameter. There is also central intrahepatic\\nduct dilatation.  The gallbladder is normal.\\n\\nThere is moderate volume ascites within the peritoneal cavity.\\nThere is splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 17.8 cm in\\nlength.

Because of\\nrepeated triggering as well as concern for airway protection,\\npatient was transferred to the ICU. In the ICU, patient was\\ncontinued on lactulose/rifaximin regimen (via NG tube) as well\\nas benzodiazepines for withdrawal. There was also concern for\\ncontinuing infection. Peritoneal tap performed which did not\\nfnid evidence of SBP. Chest CT showed ground glass opacities\\nsuspicious for pneumonia, for which patient was treated with\\nbroad spectrum antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia\\n(vancomycin and cefepime). Head CT was negative for acute\\nprocess. Abdominal ultrasound found no evidence of clot. Patient\\nalso found to have [**Last Name (un) **], which resolved with fluid resuscitation\\nand albumin. Patient thereafter returned to the floor briefly,\\nwhere he continued to be agitated and having hallucinations.\\nFlagyl was added for coverage of anaerobes/aspiration. Because\\nof respiratory distress with desaturations, worsening\\nencephalopathy, patient returned to the ICU again, where\\nantibiotics were continued for a full course for HCAP (1 week)\\nand patient was treated aggressively with lactulose for\\nencephalopathy. Abdominal CT conducted which was unremarkable.\\nPatient was noted to clear over several days. Tube feeds were\\nstarted, and patient was returned to the floor. Electrolytes\\nwere aggressively repleted. Patient remained clear throughout\\nremainder of admission.\\n\\n# ETOH/HCV CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of cirrhosis\\ncomplicated by portal hypertension, varices, variceal bleed.\\nAfter ICU course detailed above, patient continued on lactulose\\nand rifaximin. In addition, lasix and aldactone were initiated.\\nBecause of diffuse liver nodularity appreciated on CT and\\nultrasound when patient first admitted (as well as known lesion\\nin the past), MRI was conducted, which did not show evidence of\\nHCC. Patient did develop a transient leukocytosis on the floor.\\nDiagnostic paracentesis performed which showed no evidence for\\nSBP; other infectious workup was unremarkable.  Leukocytosis\\nresolved without further intervention. Plan was for patient to\\nhave close follow up with hepatology as well as PCP for\\ncontinuing management.  Patient could be reviewed for transplant\\nin ~6 months if able to remain sober.\\n\\n# ERCP/BILIARY STRICTURE: Patient initially presented for ERCP\\nfor stent removal. Strictures potentially [**12-30**] ulcerative colitis\\nwith PSC seen on ERCP.  Patient underwent ERCP for stent removal\\nand sphincterotomy on [**2163-10-4**] after stabilization s/p ICU\\ncourse, without complication.

Patient was\\nadvanced as swallowing function improved. He is cleared for\\nnectar thick liquids, ground solids and may be advanced as\\ntolerated. The day before discharge, the patient accidentally\\npulled the feeding tube while changing clothes. The tube was\\nreplaced and advanced to a post-pyloric location in\\ninterventional radiology without complication. The tube was\\nbridled.\\n\\n# HYPERKALEMIA: Patient's potassium trended up towards the end\\nof admission, felt to be likely [**12-30**] potassium sparing diuretic\\nuse.

You were admitted to the\\n[**Hospital1 18**] for treatment of altered mental status. It was likely that\\nyour altered mental status was due to both hepatic\\nencephalopathy (especially because you had not been taking\\nlactulose/rifaximin) as well as alcohol withdrawal (because of\\nyour heavy alcohol use). In addition, you were found to have a\\nlikely pneumonia, for which you were treated with IV\\nantibiotics. After an acute period of treatment requiring time\\nin the ICU (intensive care unit), your status improved\\ndramatically.\\n\\nAfter leaving the ICU, we maintained you on tube feeds. Our\\nspeech and swallow experts advised us to take advancement of\\nyour oral intake slowly, because your swallowing muscles was\\nrather weak. You tolerated tube feeds well and we will continue\\nthese after you leave.\\n\\nIn addition, you had initially presented to the hospital for a\\nfollow up ERCP procedure. We performed this procedure, in\\nconjunction with an EGD/endoscopy, and the stent was removed\\nwithout complication.\\n\\nSeveral days after returning to the medical floor, you were\\nfound to have an elevated white blood cell count (often a\\nreflection of an infection). You felt well otherwise and did not\\nhave a fever. We performed an infectious evaluation including a\\nparacentesis (sampling fluid from the belly), which was negative\\nfor an infection.

[**Name10 (NameIs) **] finally\\ncame into the hospital at [**Hospital3 **] because his pain did not go\\naway after a few days despite taking antacids. He also admits to\\ndoing 4 lines of cocaine 2 days prior to presentation. During\\nhis initial work-up at [**Hospital1 **], he was found to have ST\\ndepressions in V5 and V6 with troponin of 3.1, at which point he\\nwas transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. He received ASA, plavix 300mg, and\\nlovenox and was on a nitro gtt prior to transfer. He was also on\\nan amiodarone gtt for reported frequent ectopy.\\nIn the ED, his initial VS were: 97.2 146/85 25 95% 4L. He was\\nhaving mild chest pain and frequent runs of NSVT. Cardiology was\\nconsulted for positive biomarkers. He was put on an integrillin\\ngtt and given morphine and zofran for symptom management.

Selective coronary angiography of this\\nco-dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery\\ndisease.  The LMCA had mild disease.  The LAD had a 60-70%\\nproximal tubular lesion.  The LCX was subtotally occluded with\\ndiffuse in stent restenosis and thrombosis.  The RCA was\\ndistally occluded and filled by collaterals. 2.  Limited resting\\nhemodynamics revealed significantly elevated left sided filling\\npressures with LVEDP of 45 mm Hg.  There was no gradient upon\\npullback of the catheter from LV to the aorta.  There was mild\\nsystemic arterial hypotension of 94/65 mm Hg. 3.  Left\\nventriculography was deferred. 4.  Successful insertion of IABP.\\n\\n[**7-28**] Echo: PREGrafting: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or\\ncolor Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is moderately\\ndilated. There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular\\nsystolic dysfunction with dyskinesis of the inferolateral wall,\\nhypokinesis of the distal anterior and anterolateral walls..\\nLVEF ~25-30%. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall\\nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately\\nthickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic\\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\\nthickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The MR\\nincreased to (2+) moderate during manipulation of the heart\\nduring off pump CABG. A well positioned balloon pump catheter is\\nseen in the descending thoracic aorta. Post Grafting: 1+ mitral\\nregurgitation seen post-grafting. Aortic balloon pump catheter\\nremains in descending thoracic aorta just distal to the\\nsubclavian artery. LV function and wall motion appears mildly\\nimproved. (EF 30-35%.) The distal anterior wall appears to be\\nimproved. Previous wall motion abnormalities persist. Remaining\\nexam is unchanged from pre-grafting.\\n\\n[**2177-7-26**] 06:50AM BLOOD WBC-11.7*# RBC-4.04*# Hgb-12.5* Hct-36.4*\\nMCV-90# MCH-30.9# MCHC-34.2 RDW-13.8 Plt Ct-248\\n[**2177-7-31**] 05:11AM BLOOD WBC-9.6 RBC-2.98* Hgb-9.3* Hct-27.9*\\nMCV-94 MCH-31.2 MCHC-33.3 RDW-14.3 Plt Ct-176\\n[**2177-7-26**] 06:50AM BLOOD PT-12.7 PTT-34.1 INR(PT)-1.1\\n[**2177-7-30**] 02:10AM BLOOD PT-13.4 PTT-30.4 INR(PT)-1.1\\n[**2177-7-26**] 06:50AM BLOOD Glucose-266* UreaN-29* Creat-0.9 Na-134\\nK-6.2* Cl-98 HCO3-28 AnGap-14\\n[**2177-7-31**] 05:11AM BLOOD Glucose-179* UreaN-40* Creat-1.1 Na-130*\\nK-5.1 Cl-96 HCO3-33* AnGap-6*\\n[**2177-8-1**] 05:00PM BLOOD WBC-8.3 RBC-3.24* Hgb-10.0* Hct-29.9*\\nMCV-92 MCH-30.9 MCHC-33.5 RDW-14.3 Plt Ct-268#\\n    [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname 7167**] [**Medical Record Number 15111**] M  53  [**2124-4-21**]\\n\\nRadiology Report CHEST PORT.

When\\nhis cardiac enzymes trended up (CD 1452->1463 with positive MB\\nfraction), it was decided to take him to the cath lab. In the\\ncath lab, he was found to have a subtotally occluded LCx with\\ndiffuse in-stent restenosis. The RCA was occluded distally but\\nfilled by collaterals. His LAD had 60-70% proximal disease. It\\nwas felt that treating the LCx lesions in the cath lab might\\ncompromise his collateral circulation and he was referred to CT\\nsurgery for evaluation. Hemodynamics revealed LV EDP of 45 and\\nan IABP was placed. On [**7-28**] he was brought to the operating room\\nwhere he underwent a off-pump coronary artery bypass graft x 3.\\nPlease see operative report for surgical details. Following\\nsurgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring\\nin stable condition. Later on op day he was weaned from\\nsedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op\\nday one his IABP was removed. Beta-blockers and diuretics were\\ninitiated on this day and he was gently diuresed towards his\\npre-op weight. On post-op day two he was transferred to the\\ntelemetry floor for further care.Pain services,substance\\nabuse,psychiatry and social work were all consulted for\\nreccommendations.

significant for pulmonary embolism in\\nthe past, as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on\\nCoumadin, meniere's disease, and increasing \"memory loss\" who\\npresents from an outside hospital after having a left arm\\nshaking at home, and then having dysarthria and rapidly\\ndeclining mental status requiring intubation.\\n\\nOn head CT, he had a right frontal parietal intraparenchymal\\nhemorrhage.  He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit\\nwhere he was soon extubated, but then had another episode of\\nmental status change and was found to have pneumonia.  His\\nblood pressure was monitored closely while in the Intensive\\nCare Unit and eventually he was extubated and sent to the\\nfloor in good condition.\\n\\nOn exam, he has a left hemiplegia and left neglect, but is\\nresponsive and following commands.  He was later found to be\\nin acute respiratory distress after being called out to the\\nfloor initially and he subsequently returned to the Intensive\\nCare Unit for reintubation and then was again transferred to\\nthe floor on [**2101-11-28**] after being stabilized.  He\\ncontinued to have a rather high oxygen requirement on initial\\ncall out, however, this was eventually resolved.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\\n2.  Heart block, status post pacemaker.\\n3.  Pulmonary embolism 12 years ago in the setting of total\\nhip replacement, status post IVC filter and \"mild memory\\nloss\" according to the family.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.\\n2.  Famotidine.\\n3.  Zosyn for the pneumonia which he received a 14 day course\\nof and stopped.\\n4.  Brimonidine 0.15% eye drops.\\n5.  Timolol eye drops.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Very independent at home.  He was driving\\nwith his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] smoking or alcohol.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  No history of aneurysm or stroke.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile with blood\\npressures 138/70.  Heart rate 76.  Oxygen saturation\\ninitially 99% on face mask, but now is doing well on room\\nair.  General medical exam is unremarkable.  Neurological\\nexam:  The patient is alert and awake.  He answers\\nappropriately to questions.  He follows commands well.  He\\nhas left-sided neglect and a positive grasp reflex in the\\nright hand.  The patient has also left-sided hemiplegia with\\na left-sided facial droop and left arm and leg have 0/5\\nstrength.  The right side is full strength.  The patient also\\nhas reflexes that are slightly brisker on the right\\nthroughout.  He has a left upgoing toe and withdraws to pain\\nbilaterally in his extremities.\\n\\nLABORATORIES AND STUDIES:  On the day of discharge, his white\\nblood cell count is 9.1, hematocrit 35.3, platelet count\\n511,000, PT 13.6, PTT 28.8, INR 1.2.  Urinalysis is pending.\\nGlucose 104.  BUN 23, creatinine 0.8, sodium 138, potassium\\n3.5, chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, calcium 9.9, phosphate\\n2.9, magnesium 1.8.  Blood cultures:  No growth to date.\\nUrine culture from [**11-28**] showed no growth.  Chest x-ray\\nshowed no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure\\nand no pneumothorax.\\n\\nCT showed as mentioned, a large right frontal parietal\\nintraparenchymal hemorrhage with some leftward shift to the\\nseptum lucidum, no uncle herniation and also small amounts of\\nhemorrhage in the dependent portions of the occipital horns\\nbilaterally.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Neurology\\nService with an acute large right intraparenchymal hemorrhage\\nand severe left-sided hemiplegia with left-sided neglect.  It\\nwas felt that his hemorrhage was likely due to amyloid,\\nalthough, the patient was on Coumadin also at the time.  The\\npatient's Coumadin was stopped. Given his diagnosis of probable\\namyloid angiopathy, he is not an optimal long-term Coumadin\\ncandidate.  The patient did well throughout admission after\\nresolution of his pneumonia.  He was given a course of Zosyn for\\n14 days after which time his oxygenation became much improved and\\nhe was able to remain stable on the floor.  He had no further\\ntemperature spikes. He failed two swallow evaluations and thus\\nwas given a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube per the\\nGastrointestinal Service for his nutritional needs.\\n\\nThe patient was discharged to rehabilitation in good\\ncondition on [**2101-12-7**].  He will receive follow-up in\\nthe [**Hospital 4038**] Clinic.  The date to be scheduled before\\ndischarge. Follow-up with his PCP and Cardiology to be scheduled\\nas well to optimize management of his atrial fibrillation.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.\\n2.

He had dismissed the pain as being due to acid\\nreflux. Of note, he had stopped taking many of his cardiac\\nmedications (including plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and\\nimdur) without discussing the matter with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] finally\\ncame into the hospital at [**Hospital3 **] because his pain did not go\\naway after a few days despite taking antacids. He also admits to\\ndoing 4 lines of cocaine 2 days prior to presentation. During\\nhis initial work-up at [**Hospital1 **], he was found to have ST\\ndepressions in V5 and V6 with troponin of 3.1, at which point he\\nwas transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. He received ASA, plavix 300mg, and\\nlovenox and was on a nitro gtt prior to transfer. He was also on\\nan amiodarone gtt for reported frequent ectopy.\\nIn the ED, his initial VS were: 97.2 146/85 25 95% 4L. He was\\nhaving mild chest pain and frequent runs of NSVT. Cardiology was\\nconsulted for positive biomarkers. He was put on an integrillin\\ngtt and given morphine and zofran for symptom management.

On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded\\nregion within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9\\nmm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may\\nrepresent an unusual focus of red marrow. No sclerosis is seen\\non the corresponding plain films. There is a small right hip\\njoint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint\\nas well, at the upper limits of normal. There is no soft tissue\\nabnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.\\nIMPRESSION: 1. Small right hip joint effusion. 2. No bone marrow\\nedema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis. 3. Nonspecific small\\nfocus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral\\nhead is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red\\nmarrow.\\n\\nTTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.

Patient was on the floor on [**9-20**],\\ngiven morphine for the hip pain.  She then had an episode of\\nhypotension and unresponsiveness and transferred to the MICU for\\ncloser monitoring. The patient got 2L IVFs and narcan and\\nimproved, in fact, found to be hypertensive upon arrival to\\nMICU.\\n.\\nMICU Course: On [**9-20**], the patient triggered for hypotension\\n(82/45), hypothermia (92.9) and altered mental status with\\ndifficult arousability in setting of recent blood transfusion.\\nConcern was for sepsis, autonomic seizure, transfusion reaction,\\npulmonary embolus and/or narcosis.  Mental status cleared\\nsomewhat with narcan. Renal c/s felt episode likely [**2-11**]\\naccumulation of morphine active metabolites. V/Q scan\\ndemonstrated improvement since prior study. Patient's home\\nprednisone dose was increased from 5 to 15mg with thought that\\npatient may be stressed in setting of acute illness. She was\\nfebrile on [**9-21**] and resultingly started in vancomycin,\\naztreonam, and levofloxacin. PD fluid was not c/w SBP. CXR was\\nclear. Urine culture and blood cultures are pending. Patient's\\nBP was in the 110s so hydralazine was stopped. Her other BP meds\\nwere otherwise continued.  Plan was/is to follow renal recs for\\nPD. If, in 24-48 hours (once cultures have had 48-72 hours to\\ngrow) no source has been located, would d/c antibiotics except\\nfor levofloxacin.  Would continue levoflox for total 5 day\\ncourse for pneumonia possibly ? aspiration pneumonitis during\\nepisode of altered mental status.  If patient has leg pain\\nagain, may consider neurogenic source such a piriformis syndrome\\nas suggested by neurology. Would add neurontin 100mg TID with\\nroom to titrate up to 300mg TID. Neuro also recommended PT with\\nTENS unit and referral to pain clinic although patient's pain is\\ncurrently absent.\\n.\\nFYI **** per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] --- Because of ? increase in\\ncardiomegaly on CXR, she got an echo yesterday.  In addition to\\nher known HOCM, this showed (1) a small pericardial effusion,\\nand (2) pulmonary hypertension with an estimated tricuspid\\ngradient of 50 mm Hg. They probably need to be followed up over\\ntime (particularly the pulmonary hypertension).  We did\\nevaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making\\nchronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.\\nIt would be good if we could arrange a PULMONARY CLINIC FOLLOW\\nUP for Ms. [**Known lastname **] after discharge with either [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].****\\n\\n.\\nShe underwent CT head, and V/Q scan which were unremarkable.\\nHer steroid dose was increased to 15mg given concern for need\\nfor stress dose steroids. After transfer from the MICU, her\\nsteroids were dropped back to 5mg, her home dose with the\\napproval of [**Last Name (un) **].\\n.\\nHer hypotensive episode was thought to be due to a delayed\\nclearing of the morphine due to her renal failure.  Her\\nhydralazine was discontinued.  On day 2 of her MICU stay, she\\ndeveloped a fever to 102.  She was pan-cultured (blood, urine,\\nperitoneal dialysate) without obvious source of infection.\\nBroad spectrum abx were started (vanco, cipro, aztreonam (pcn\\nallergy)) empirically.  There was question of retrocardiac\\nopacity on CXR, though not clear. Rheum consult obtained given\\nhip discomfort, who felt septic joint unlikely.  Neurology\\nconsult obtained who felt autonomic seizure unlikely.\\n.\\nPt initiated peritoneal dialysis.  In this setting she has been\\nhaving some nausea, which has made taking her home labetalol\\ndifficult, resulting in some rising BPs.  She is called out to\\nmedical service for ongoing management and workup of fever,\\nnausea, and hypertension.  Her hip pain has resolved completely\\nwithout further intervention.\\n.\\nFloor course:\\nFever: Spike fever in MICU to 102. Started on Levoquin,\\nAztreonam, and Vanc. Source unclear at this point, but CXR with\\nquestion of retrocardiac opacity. There is a possibility of\\naspiration pneumonitis. Other etiologies include peritoneal\\nfluid (PD cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have\\nany indwelling lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be\\nseptic arthritis but no pain with movement on exam makes this\\nless likely. Peritoneal dialysis cultures negative so far.\\nContinued levo/vanco/aztreonam for 2 days empirically. Then\\nd/ced the Abx as no infectious etiologies were found. Steroids\\nback to home dosage. BCx, UCx (final neg), Peritoneal cultures\\nnegative at discharge.\\n.\\n# Labile blood pressure: h/o of difficult to control BP with\\nepisodes of hypertensive emergency in the past. Normal SBP runs\\nin 170s. Having nausea in setting of new PD, no evidence of\\nintracranial bleeding on clinical exam, though INR had been\\nsupratherapeutic so remains in differential, though not\\nbradycardic. Continue home BP meds :Labetalol 900 mg PO TID but\\ndifficult for patient to tolerate due to nausea, Aliskiren *NF*\\n150 mg Oral [**Hospital1 **], NIFEdipine CR 60 mg PO DAILY, clonidine patch,\\nhydralazine given hypertensive in setting of nausa.\\n.\\n# Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or\\nfracture on MRI though there is a small effusion.

On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded\\nregion within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9\\nmm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may\\nrepresent an unusual focus of red marrow. No sclerosis is seen\\non the corresponding plain films. There is a small right hip\\njoint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint\\nas well, at the upper limits of normal. There is no soft tissue\\nabnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.\\nIMPRESSION: 1. Small right hip joint effusion. 2. No bone marrow\\nedema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis. 3. Nonspecific small\\nfocus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral\\nhead is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red\\nmarrow.\\n\\nTTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is\\nsevere symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\\nventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular\\nwall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is\\nhyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18 mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is\\nidentified. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\\nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally\\nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The\\nincreased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac\\noutput. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no\\nsystolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)\\nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\\nsystolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.\\nThe effusion appears circumferential. There are no\\nechocardiographic signs of tamponade.\\nIMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\\nhyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient.\\nMild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.\\nFindings consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**],\\npulmonary hypertension has developed (also present on the study\\nfrom [**2140-5-20**]).

Patient was on the floor on [**9-20**],\\ngiven morphine for the hip pain.  She then had an episode of\\nhypotension and unresponsiveness and transferred to the MICU for\\ncloser monitoring. The patient got 2L IVFs and narcan and\\nimproved, in fact, found to be hypertensive upon arrival to\\nMICU.\\n.\\nMICU Course: On [**9-20**], the patient triggered for hypotension\\n(82/45), hypothermia (92.9) and altered mental status with\\ndifficult arousability in setting of recent blood transfusion.\\nConcern was for sepsis, autonomic seizure, transfusion reaction,\\npulmonary embolus and/or narcosis.  Mental status cleared\\nsomewhat with narcan. Renal c/s felt episode likely [**2-11**]\\naccumulation of morphine active metabolites. V/Q scan\\ndemonstrated improvement since prior study. Patient's home\\nprednisone dose was increased from 5 to 15mg with thought that\\npatient may be stressed in setting of acute illness. She was\\nfebrile on [**9-21**] and resultingly started in vancomycin,\\naztreonam, and levofloxacin. PD fluid was not c/w SBP. CXR was\\nclear. Urine culture and blood cultures are pending. Patient's\\nBP was in the 110s so hydralazine was stopped. Her other BP meds\\nwere otherwise continued.  Plan was/is to follow renal recs for\\nPD. If, in 24-48 hours (once cultures have had 48-72 hours to\\ngrow) no source has been located, would d/c antibiotics except\\nfor levofloxacin.  Would continue levoflox for total 5 day\\ncourse for pneumonia possibly ? aspiration pneumonitis during\\nepisode of altered mental status.  If patient has leg pain\\nagain, may consider neurogenic source such a piriformis syndrome\\nas suggested by neurology. Would add neurontin 100mg TID with\\nroom to titrate up to 300mg TID. Neuro also recommended PT with\\nTENS unit and referral to pain clinic although patient's pain is\\ncurrently absent.\\n.\\nFYI **** per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] --- Because of ? increase in\\ncardiomegaly on CXR, she got an echo yesterday.  In addition to\\nher known HOCM, this showed (1) a small pericardial effusion,\\nand (2) pulmonary hypertension with an estimated tricuspid\\ngradient of 50 mm Hg. They probably need to be followed up over\\ntime (particularly the pulmonary hypertension).  We did\\nevaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making\\nchronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.\\nIt would be good if we could arrange a PULMONARY CLINIC FOLLOW\\nUP for Ms. [**Known lastname **] after discharge with either [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].****\\n\\n.\\nShe underwent CT head, and V/Q scan which were unremarkable.\\nHer steroid dose was increased to 15mg given concern for need\\nfor stress dose steroids. After transfer from the MICU, her\\nsteroids were dropped back to 5mg, her home dose with the\\napproval of [**Last Name (un) **].\\n.\\nHer hypotensive episode was thought to be due to a delayed\\nclearing of the morphine due to her renal failure.  Her\\nhydralazine was discontinued.  On day 2 of her MICU stay, she\\ndeveloped a fever to 102.  She was pan-cultured (blood, urine,\\nperitoneal dialysate) without obvious source of infection.\\nBroad spectrum abx were started (vanco, cipro, aztreonam (pcn\\nallergy)) empirically.  There was question of retrocardiac\\nopacity on CXR, though not clear. Rheum consult obtained given\\nhip discomfort, who felt septic joint unlikely.  Neurology\\nconsult obtained who felt autonomic seizure unlikely.\\n.\\nPt initiated peritoneal dialysis.  In this setting she has been\\nhaving some nausea, which has made taking her home labetalol\\ndifficult, resulting in some rising BPs.  She is called out to\\nmedical service for ongoing management and workup of fever,\\nnausea, and hypertension.  Her hip pain has resolved completely\\nwithout further intervention.\\n.\\nFloor course:\\nFever: Spike fever in MICU to 102. Started on Levoquin,\\nAztreonam, and Vanc. Source unclear at this point, but CXR with\\nquestion of retrocardiac opacity. There is a possibility of\\naspiration pneumonitis. Other etiologies include peritoneal\\nfluid (PD cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have\\nany indwelling lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be\\nseptic arthritis but no pain with movement on exam makes this\\nless likely. Peritoneal dialysis cultures negative so far.\\nContinued levo/vanco/aztreonam for 2 days empirically. Then\\nd/ced the Abx as no infectious etiologies were found. Steroids\\nback to home dosage. BCx, UCx (final neg), Peritoneal cultures\\nnegative at discharge.\\n.\\n# Labile blood pressure: h/o of difficult to control BP with\\nepisodes of hypertensive emergency in the past. Normal SBP runs\\nin 170s. Having nausea in setting of new PD, no evidence of\\nintracranial bleeding on clinical exam, though INR had been\\nsupratherapeutic so remains in differential, though not\\nbradycardic. Continue home BP meds :Labetalol 900 mg PO TID but\\ndifficult for patient to tolerate due to nausea, Aliskiren *NF*\\n150 mg Oral [**Hospital1 **], NIFEdipine CR 60 mg PO DAILY, clonidine patch,\\nhydralazine given hypertensive in setting of nausa.\\n.\\n# Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or\\nfracture on MRI though there is a small effusion.

Extremity examination shows right\\nextremity is warm and left extremity proximal to the medial\\nmalleolus with 3 by 4 ulceration with surrounding erythema\\nand cellulitis.  Pulse examination shows palpable femorals\\nbilaterally with palpable popliteals bilaterally.  The right\\ndorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse were\\ndopplerable and the left dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior\\ntibial pulse were dopplerable.\\n\\nLABORATORY:  CBC with a white blood cell count of 20.1,\\nhematocrit 29.7, platelets 62K, BUN 12, creatinine 0.6, K\\n3.6.  [**Name (NI) 2591**] PT/INR 16.5 and 1.9, PTT 35.  Chest x-ray was no\\nactive cardiopulmonary disease.  Electrocardiogram showed no\\nevidence of ischemia and normal sinus rhythm with a rate of\\n81.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Vascular\\nService.  He was continued on his preadmission medications\\nincluding Unasyn 1.5 grams q 6 hours.  Surgical dressings\\nwere normal saline and wet to dry dressings b.i.d. to the\\neffected ulcer site.  The patient underwent venous duplexes\\non [**2190-6-8**] to asses for vein conduit for bypass grafting.  The\\npatient underwent on [**2190-6-6**] an arteriogram, which\\ndemonstrated a gradient across the aortic to the common iliac\\non the left with a 12 mm gradient.  Along the common iliac\\nthere was more gradient of 180 mg across the stent.  It was\\n156 mm with stenosis at the distal start and an occluded left\\nsuperficial femoral artery popliteal.  The AT refilled below\\nthe fibular head and was open all the way to the dorsalis\\npedis pulses.  The patient tolerated the arteriogram.  PICC\\nlines were attempted to provide intravenous access, but the\\nveins were too small and this was aborted.\\n\\nThe patient had an arterial blood gas done in preparation for\\nrevascularization of his lower leg, pH was 7.51, PO2 61, PCO2\\nwas 36, CO2 30, base excess 5.  The patient underwent on\\n[**2190-6-11**] a left femoral AT bypass graft to the PTFE.  He\\ntolerated the procedure well.  He was transferred to the PACU\\nin stable condition.  Immediate postoperative check he was\\nhemodynamically stable.  Postoperatively, hematocrit was\\n32.4, PTT 84.8, BUN 6, creatinine 0.6.  His extremity was\\nwarm with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse and absent patient.\\nHe continued to do well and was transferred to the VICU.\\nPostoperative day one there were no overnight events.  He\\ncontinued on Vancomycin, Levo and Flagyl.  His diet was\\nadvanced as tolerated.  He required Lasix to diurese.  He was\\nD-lined and transferred to the regular nursing floor.  On [**6-14**]\\nthe patient underwent debridement of the left ankle\\nulceration he tolerated the procedure well and was\\ntransferred to the regular nursing floor.  Coumadin was begun\\non 3 mg per day, ambulation was instituted.  A request for\\nPICC line was requested, but this could not be done.  He was\\ncontinued on his antibiotics and the Foley was discontinued\\nand rehab screening was begun.\\n\\nPhysical therapy saw the patient and recommended short term\\nrehabilitation to improve his mobility and gait.  A reattempt\\nwill be made to place the PICC line at the bedside.  If this\\nis unable to be done, then it will be done in interventional\\nradiology.  He will continue on his antibiotics for a total\\nof two more weeks post discharge.\\n\\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  He is to follow up with Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks time.  Goal INR is 2.0 to 2.5.  INR\\nshould be monitored until the patient has reached the steady\\ntherapeutic state.
