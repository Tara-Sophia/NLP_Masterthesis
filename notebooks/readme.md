# Notebooks

## Description

Jupyter notebooks should be used for prototyping, exploring and communicating findings, but not for long-term usage. Notebooks should be divided into sub-folders such as Notebooks\explorations and Notebooks\PoC.

The naming convention is as follows: step-user-description.ipynb (i.e. 01-tm-eda.ipynb) where the step serves as an ordering mechanism, the creatorâ€™s initials, and description of what the notebook contains.
